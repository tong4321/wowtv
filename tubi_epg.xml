As a result, Yami Marik becomes angered, and attacks Odion with the Millennium Rod, which weakens Odion even more. Odion doesn't give up, despite Ishizu's protests. As Marik continues his onslaught (which begins to injure Odion), Odion tells Marik's good side that together, they had conquered his evil half before, and that they could do it again. Then, he tells the good Marik that since Yami Marik was created by the good Marik's hatred, he has the power to destroy him. As Yami Marik raises the Rod to deliver the final blow, the good Marik disappears from the field, and begins fighting against Yami Marik, who struggles for control over Marik's body, and refuses to be defeated. However, Marik's good half stalls Yami Marik long enough for Yugi to activate his spell card. Yugi's Ragnarok spell succeeds in destroying (and removing to the graveyard) Ra, allowing the good Marik to regain control of his body. However, a sliver of Yami Marik reappears on the field, although this time, he is the victim. Yami Marik tries to convince the good Marik to help him seize the Millennium Items and rule the world together, but fails as Marik has decided to stop being evil and make up for his actions. Marik surrenders the duel to Yugi, which sends Yami Marik to the Shadow Realm, ending the Battle City finals. Bakura and Mai are returned from the shadow realm and Marik is reunited with his siblings, who forgive him. Yugi receives the three Egyptian God Cards. Kaiba then activates the Duel Tower's self-destruct sequence, giving everybody one hour to get off the island before it explodes.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000033" start="20251010160000 +0000" stop="20251010163000 +0000"><title>Yu-Gi-Oh!

From riding bulls in Fort Worth to off-roading in the Chihuahuan desert to forging their own path across this vast state with the help of local trailblazers Liz and Lou Lambert. Lucky for us, they even stopped by Huckberry’s own backyard in Austin for a quick ruck and a couple games of chicken sh*t bingo. When the dust finally settled, we fired up the barbecue for our beefiest feast yet and raised our ranch waters high to 10 DIRT episodes in the can.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20251010145008 +0000" stop="20251010153000 +0000"><title>Dirt</title><desc>For DIRT’s first trip across the pond, host Josh Rosen dove head first into Ireland.

Six black males had been brutally murdered--two had their hearts cut out.  The only thing connecting the victims was their ethnicity and the fact that each had been shot with .22 caliber bullets. Residents screamed for the police to stop this serial killer.  With no suspects, local investigators turned to the FBI.  Profilers were able to produce a psychological composite of the type of person the killer would most likely be.  Their analysis paid off.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000091" start="20251010172000 +0000" stop="20251010182100 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>In Memphis, Tennessee, a horrible crime terrified local residents.
