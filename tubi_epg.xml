Shortly before leaving their hotel they mention they haven't been able to find what they're looking for; "something old and derelict that they can do up." Anne Merrick tells them about Winyard, a tumbledown cottage in the woods, might be for sale. At the estate agents they are told the house is not yet available for viewing. Later that evening they find the house on their own. However, Caroline has read up on the cottage's haunted reputation and only reluctantly explores it with Peter. The next morning they are found strangled in their own car. DCI Barnaby starts the investigation with the help of PC Ben Jones and they come across the world of estate agents, identical twins, ghosts, piano wire, and more before another body turns up.</desc></programme><programme channel="684167" start="20250701120000 +0000" stop="20250701140000 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>Villagers of Midsomer Barton are all set to celebrate Oak Apple Week, especially as the carnival queen event is set to return after an eight year absence.

Later that evening they find the house on their own. However, Caroline has read up on the cottage's haunted reputation and only reluctantly explores it with Peter.

The restaurant is losing money by the bucket-load and the two best friends who run it are at war with each other. The owner Justin Rowntree won't listen to reason, and his head chef and best friend Ritchie has had enough. To make matters worse the credit crunch has hit and there is fierce competition from corporate chains.

Gordon has a torrid time putting them on the road to recovery, but come the autumn, they are sticking to his rules and business is looking brighter. 

With the advent of the credit crunch, soaring food prices, thrifty clientele and unrelenting competition from the high street chains, Gordon is determined to galvanise the owners, the staff and the local community to ensure their survival and keep customers coming back for more.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250701231000 +0000" stop="20250702001000 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers</title><desc>Jay saves Luke's bacon with a polished portrait; Sketch beautifies Mark's belly Buddha.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250702001000 +0000" stop="20250702010800 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers</title><desc>Alice tackles Beverley's backside blunder; Jay wipes Bailey's holiday Poomoji tatt clean.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250702010800 +0000" stop="20250702020800 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers</title><desc>John's tattoo is on another planet, while Alec has made a big mistake with a tiny inking.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250702020800 +0000" stop="20250702030700 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers</title><desc>Jay gives Ian a portrait that has to be seen to be believed and Alice covers Linsey's scar.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250702030700 +0000" stop="20250702035900 +0000"><title>Hotel Hell</title><desc>Gordon visits Starkville, Mississippi to try to rescue the failing Hotel Chester.
