This week we are forced to take notice of Demolition Dave, a 49 yr old South Australia man who thanks to some home training smashes the qualifier. For those lucky enough to survive the Fly Screen Sweeper it was Dizzy Dummy time. Emerging as the Dark Horse, Kobie Mulligan earned herself a shot in the Wipeout Zone, joined by a Strategist and Rubber Woman resulting in a bitter showdown.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20250628010840 +0000" stop="20250628020332 +0000"><title>Wipeout Australia</title><desc>From singing Pastors to Wookies, this week is jammed pack with Characters, who battle it out on the Qualifier with amusing attempts at the inconceivable Field Goal Swing. Its no easy task to earn a spot in the Wipeout Zone this week with the Dreadmill, sorting the men from the boys. Contestants must dodge the wrecking ball while shooting basketballs. Although there is one man who came prepared, Dodgeball Champion Dan Bennett, whose “Duck, Dive, Dip, Dodge and Dunk” training comes into play.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20250628020332 +0000" stop="20250628025721 +0000"><title>Wipeout Australia</title><desc>20 Greatest Hits</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20250628025721 +0000" stop="20250628040821 +0000"><title>Total Wipeout</title><desc>Twenty contestants take on one of television's largest and most extreme obstacle courses.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20250628040821 +0000" stop="20250628051600 +0000"><title>Total Wipeout</title><desc>In this episode, contestants face different games like The Qualifier and The Dizzy Dummies.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20250628051600 +0000" stop="20250628062330 +0000"><title>Total Wipeout</title><desc>Amanda Byram assists Richard from the sidelines as contestants take on a challenge called like The Qualifier.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20250628062330 +0000" stop="20250628072854 +0000"><title>Total Wipeout</title><desc>This week they have added two new obstacles to 'The Qualifier' game.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20250628072854 +0000" stop="20250628084155 +0000"><title>Total Wipeout</title><desc>In this episode, contestants face different games like The Qualifier and The Sweeper.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20250628084155 +0000" stop="20250628095518 +0000"><title>Total Wipeout</title><desc>Twenty contestants take on one of television's largest and most extreme obstacle courses.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20250628095518 +0000" stop="20250628110820 +0000"><title>Total Wipeout</title><desc>Will Ali the penguin keeper slip and slide his way to success on the Qualifier?</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20250628110820 +0000" stop="20250628122229 +0000"><title>Total Wipeout</title><desc>Some of the obstacles the contestants face are the “Bouncy Balls” and “The Sweeper”.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20250628122229 +0000" stop="20250628133516 +0000"><title>Total Wipeout</title><desc>In this episode, the North of the country takes on the South in a battle to win the coveted trophy.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20250628133516 +0000" stop="20250628144842 +0000"><title>Total Wipeout</title><desc>Total Wipeout is back with this exciting last season!</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20250628144842 +0000" stop="20250628160157 +0000"><title>Total Wipeout</title><desc>Ordinary British folk fly halfway across the world to test their endurance and bouncability in Argentina.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20250628160157 +0000" stop="20250628171520 +0000"><title>Total Wipeout</title><desc>20 contestants take on four gruelling courses to win the title of Wipeout Champion.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20250628171520 +0000" stop="20250628182823 +0000"><title>Total Wipeout</title><desc>In the first episode of season 3, Richard Hammond introduces a brand new challenge called Crash Mountain.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20250628182823 +0000" stop="20250628194145 +0000"><title>Total Wipeout</title><desc>Richard and Amanda guide 20 foolhardy Brits through the biggest and daftest obstacle course in the universe.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20250628194145 +0000" stop="20250628205246 +0000"><title>Total Wipeout</title><desc>Twenty contestants take on one of television's largest and most extreme obstacle courses.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20250628205246 +0000" stop="20250628220016 +0000"><title>Total Wipeout</title><desc>Amanda Byram assists Richard from the sidelines as contestants take on a challenge called like The Qualifier.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20250628220016 +0000" stop="20250628231530 +0000"><title>Total Wipeout</title><desc>This is the second 'Celebrity Special' of the season.

Second only to Alaska in size, Texas is known as the place where everything is bigger. From big college football games to endless oil fields and vast wind farms, Texas is home to more than 30 million Americans. But the state is about more than just big oil, college football and cattle farms - it's also home to some of the best boating in the country. Boasting a myriad of waterways, boaters here enjoy hundreds of lakes, rivers and streams that provide recreational opportunities, abundant wildlife and plenty of fishing. From Austin Texas to San Antonio host Ryan McVinney and the Boat Trader crew explore the laid-back Texas lake life including boat up restaurants along the Colorado River, watersports in Austin and the history of the waterways throughout the region. Boat manufacturers highlighted in this episode are Tige Boats and ATX Surf Boats, two premium Texas-based wake boat brands known for their high-quality, cutting-edge vessels that come equipped with advanced wake shaping technologies and equipment ideal for water skiing, wake surfing and wakeboarding. There's even a wake surfing dog!</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20250628113002 +0000" stop="20250628120000 +0000"><title>Breaking Boundaries</title><desc>Day 2 of the Green River experience, JP wade fishes with Remick Smothers.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20250628120000 +0000" stop="20250628123001 +0000"><title>FinQuest</title><desc>Ryan Miller targets exotic fish in Lake Ida with local guide Kevin Cannon in Episode 2 of FinQuest.

Set in beautiful Welsh countryside, The Walnut Tree Inn was a successful business for 37 years and became a national institution. But when Francesco bought the place 3 years ago he made the mistake of turning the warm and welcoming country inn into a cold and stark London-style restaurant. And when things went wrong he tried to run the kitchen as well as the front of house.
With its Michelin star in jeopardy, Ramsay's first job was to recruit a new head chef so the owner could concentrate on customers. But has Francesco managed to follow Ramsay's advice and stop meddling in the kitchen?</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250628005100 +0000" stop="20250628015200 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>In tonight's program Gordon Ramsay travels to the seaside to help ailing hotel and restaurant, The Sandgate.
