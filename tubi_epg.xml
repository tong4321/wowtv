The pub is run by landlord Brian who, after thirty years in the business and a quadruple heart-bypass, still puts in 120 hours a week and insists on laying down the law in the kitchen. Despite their best endeavours Brian and his partner Elaine are ~£250k in debt, losing ~1500 a week and facing bankruptcy within three months unless there's a drastic reversal in their fortunes.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250629214000 +0000" stop="20250629224000 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>In tonight's programme Gordon finds a chef caught in a time warp when he tackles a picturesque but largely unfrequented upmarket restaurant in King's Lynn, a traditional market town on the Norfolk coast. For the last eighteen months ex Michelin-starred chef Nick has owned and run Rococo but his past success is now eluding him. The menu is past its sell-by date, the service is stuffy, the food is over-priced and the only thing being fed is his ego. Yet, despite debts of ~£100k and the prospect of putting his home at risk and his young family on the streets, Nick continues to cook comatose in a 1990s fantasy land of his own making.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250629224000 +0000" stop="20250629234000 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>In tonight's final programme of the series Gordon grapples with girl power when he takes on an intimate family-run restaurant in the heart of WAG territory near Liverpool. For the last three years Morgan's has been run by antiques dealer-turned-restaurateur SANDY and her two daughters HELEN and LAURA. The beautifully-designed dining room has a prime high street location and should be the perfect eatery for the trendy local clientele. But Head Chef Phil is grappling with an eclectic menu that includes mashed potato with apricots and his cooking's just not up to it.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250629234000 +0000" stop="20250630004100 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The venue for tonight's first programme is La Lanterna in Letchworth, Hertfordshire. Twenty-eight-year-old owner and head chef Alex offers modern Italian cuisine, a taste of Little Italy in England's first garden city, and the restaurant is run by his best mate maitre dé Gavin, helped by his ex-air hostess girlfriend Emily. But Alex has no customers, cookers that don't work and an expensive menu that's about as authentically Italian as a spag bol.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250630004100 +0000" stop="20250630014200 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The venue for tonight's second programme is D-Place in Chelmsford, Essex run by Mexican-born Israel and his English partner Tara. They've sunk ~£150,000 of their own money into their trendy café bar which offers a vast selection of fusion cuisine. In charge is Executive Chef Philippe, producing everything from all-day breakfasts to hoi sin noodles with an astounding lack of flair; the plastic food is dire and boomerangs back from the dining room as soon as it's cooked.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250630014200 +0000" stop="20250630024300 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>Chef Gordon Ramsay helps a soul food restaurant owner who can't seem to let her head chef do any of the cooking.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250630024300 +0000" stop="20250630034400 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The venue for tonight's fourth programme is La Riviera, a fine dining restaurant in Inverness.

Loic is on a mission, to bring sophisticated French cooking to the home of haggis, tatties and deep-fried Mars bars. But though he's hungry for success, he's French, he's arrogant and the food's pretentious.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250630034400 +0000" stop="20250630044500 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The venue for tonight's program is Clubway 41, despite being voted Blackpool Tourist Board Restaurant of the year, the place is dire straits. It is the prime example of HOW NOT TO RUN A RESTAURANT. Owner DAVE is the flakey self-appointed head chef, who hasn't been in a kitchen for 30 years and can't cook. His partner DAWN invents bizarre dishes for the menu, ranging from "tomato and cointreau soup" to "pork with brie, nectarine and whiskey sauce". Gordon faces a hellish week, Clubway 41 is breaking every rule in book, can he bring Dave, Dawn and their food back to earth?</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250630044500 +0000" stop="20250630054500 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The Walnut Tree Inn was in big trouble - there was no head chef, the customers had dwindled, and the owner had been forced to sell the family home to keep the business afloat.
Set in beautiful Welsh countryside, The Walnut Tree Inn was a successful business for 37 years and became a national institution. But when Francesco bought the place 3 years ago he made the mistake of turning the warm and welcoming country inn into a cold and stark London-style restaurant. And when things went wrong he tried to run the kitchen as well as the front of house.
With its Michelin star in jeopardy, Ramsay's first job was to recruit a new head chef so the owner could concentrate on customers. But has Francesco managed to follow Ramsay's advice and stop meddling in the kitchen?</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250630054500 +0000" stop="20250630064700 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>In tonight's program Gordon Ramsay travels to the seaside to help ailing hotel and restaurant, The Sandgate.

New owner Daniela bought the place because she got married there back in the day but her sentimentality has blinded her to the fact that she's bagged a white elephant. Gordon's biggest problem is head chef Steve, one of the worst he's ever met, and one who'd rather open a tin of tuna or a packet of soup than create a proper meal. Can Gordon get the kitchen cooking again and save La Gondala from sinking?</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250630074700 +0000" stop="20250630083900 +0000"><title>Hotel Hell</title><desc>Gordon Ramsay checks in to the Juniper Hill Inn in Windsor, VT, a place that looks like a million dollars but smells of raw sewage.
