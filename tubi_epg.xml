This time, we’re in Grant, Florida, where 4 million clams are being released into the Indian River Lagoon, paired with the planting of thousands of mangroves, oyster work by CCA and trash clean ups to help restore one of Florida’s most critical ecosystems. But it’s not just about hard work—it’s about connection. With local captains, fishing legends, and the Local Knowledge crew on hand, we hit the water to show why this place is worth fighting for. From clam drops by drone, to in-water mangrove planting, to monster snook catches, this is hands-on conservation at its best. This two-part series kicks off with action, heart, and the kind of hope only a healthy waterway can bring.

Led by Cory Redwine, Conservation Director of Project SeaSafe, this is the 4th Annual Clean Water Collective and it’s bigger than ever. This time, we’re in Grant, Florida, where 4 million clams are being released into the Indian River Lagoon, paired with the planting of thousands of mangroves, oyster work by CCA and trash clean ups to help restore one of Florida’s most critical ecosystems. But it’s not just about hard work—it’s about connection. With local captains, fishing legends, and the Local Knowledge crew on hand, we hit the water to show why this place is worth fighting for. From clam drops by drone, to in-water mangrove planting, to monster snook catches, this is hands-on conservation at its best. This two-part series kicks off with action, heart, and the kind of hope only a healthy waterway can bring. Don’t miss Part 1—where conservation meets community and everyone gets their hands wet.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20251002190001 +0000" stop="20251002193001 +0000"><title>Winchester Life</title><desc>Nestled in the hills of Ohio just west of the Appalachians is a very special deer camp ripe with memories from deer season’s past.
