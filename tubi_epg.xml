The pub is run by landlord Brian who, after thirty years in the business and a quadruple heart-bypass, still puts in 120 hours a week and insists on laying down the law in the kitchen. Despite their best endeavours Brian and his partner Elaine are ~£250k in debt, losing ~1500 a week and facing bankruptcy within three months unless there's a drastic reversal in their fortunes.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250620094800 +0000" stop="20250620104800 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>In tonight's programme Gordon finds a chef caught in a time warp when he tackles a picturesque but largely unfrequented upmarket restaurant in King's Lynn, a traditional market town on the Norfolk coast. For the last eighteen months ex Michelin-starred chef Nick has owned and run Rococo but his past success is now eluding him. The menu is past its sell-by date, the service is stuffy, the food is over-priced and the only thing being fed is his ego. Yet, despite debts of ~£100k and the prospect of putting his home at risk and his young family on the streets, Nick continues to cook comatose in a 1990s fantasy land of his own making.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250620104800 +0000" stop="20250620114800 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>In tonight's final programme of the series Gordon grapples with girl power when he takes on an intimate family-run restaurant in the heart of WAG territory near Liverpool. For the last three years Morgan's has been run by antiques dealer-turned-restaurateur SANDY and her two daughters HELEN and LAURA. The beautifully-designed dining room has a prime high street location and should be the perfect eatery for the trendy local clientele. But Head Chef Phil is grappling with an eclectic menu that includes mashed potato with apricots and his cooking's just not up to it.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250620114800 +0000" stop="20250620124800 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The venue is The Runaway Girl, a tapas bar-cum-nightclub in Sheffield city centre on the brink of collapse. The restaurant is losing money by the bucket-load and the two best friends who run it are at war with each other. The owner Justin Rowntree won't listen to reason, and his head chef and best friend Ritchie has had enough. To make matters worse the credit crunch has hit and there is fierce competition from corporate chains. 

Gordon is on hand to help the friend's weather the storm with a credit crunch menu solution designed to take on the chains, but can Gordon save Justin's failing business, and prevent his friendship with Ritchie ending up in tatters?</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250620124800 +0000" stop="20250620134800 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The Dovecote is a bistro in the heart of rural Devon run by a family at breaking point. The restaurant is on its last legs - they've run out of customers, money and hope. Enter Gordon, who on his first visit to the bistro is confronted with hideous wallpaper, vacuum packed lamb and a pig-headed head chef and owner who can't face up to his mistakes. Gordon has a torrid time putting them on the road to recovery, but come the autumn, they are sticking to his rules and business is looking brighter. 

With the advent of the credit crunch, soaring food prices, thrifty clientele and unrelenting competition from the high street chains, Gordon is determined to galvanise the owners, the staff and the local community to ensure their survival and keep customers coming back for more.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250620134800 +0000" stop="20250620144300 +0000"><title>Helicopter ER</title><desc>Fly along with helicopter doctors and paramedics of the Yorkshire Air Ambulance, where cutting-edge modern emergency medicine saves lives every day.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250620144300 +0000" stop="20250620153900 +0000"><title>Helicopter ER</title><desc>In Bradford, a man critically injured in a hit-and-run accident gives a difficult case to Dr. Tim.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250620153900 +0000" stop="20250620163500 +0000"><title>Helicopter ER</title><desc>There's a serious crash on a coastal road and the team must care for three serious casualties.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250620163500 +0000" stop="20250620173700 +0000"><title>Gordon's Great Escape</title><desc>Gordon Ramsay starts his culinary journey in the north of India where he cooks for 400 passengers in an express train's cramped pantry car.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250620173700 +0000" stop="20250620183800 +0000"><title>Gordon's Great Escape</title><desc>Gordon immerses himself in the life of a local tribe in Nagaland, visits Assam to enter a housewives' competition and sets up shop on the streets of Calcutta.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250620183800 +0000" stop="20250620193900 +0000"><title>Gordon's Great Escape</title><desc>Gordon ends his travels to India by heading south, living in an ashram in Kerala and working alongside one of India's top chefs in Mumbai.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250620193900 +0000" stop="20250620203900 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The venue for tonight's programme is The Fish &amp; Anchor, a restaurant and bar near Lampeter in rural West Wales, owned and run by ex-boxer Mike and his wife Caron.

To find the woman and her abductor, investigators would have to first determine the motive.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000091" start="20250620171600 +0000" stop="20250620181400 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>A stranger snatched an eight-year-old girl as she played in her Tucson, Arizona neighborhood, leaving behind an abandoned bicycle and a frantic mother.  Hundreds of citizens and police officers fanned out across the region, hoping to find some trace of the young girl or her abductor.  Within hours, a suspect emerged; a drifter who was out on parole for abducting and molesting children.  He was nowhere to be found and time had run out for the innocent child.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000091" start="20250620181400 +0000" stop="20250620191000 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>After a series of brutal bank robberies and murders in south Miami during the mid-1980's, the FBI embarked on an exhaustive eight-month investigation.  With little evidence and no suspects, agents were willing to try anything to find the violent perpetrators.  On April 11, 1986, agents conducting routine surveillance spotted the vehicle used in the bank robberies.  They attempted to arrest the two suspects in the car.  What followed was the bloodiest firefight in FBI history.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000091" start="20250620191000 +0000" stop="20250620200800 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>A day that began with a class field trip ended with a parent's worst nightmare.  An 11-year-old girl was missing.  Her parents were certain she was no runaway.  When they failed to find her in their quiet Illinois neighborhood, they called the police.  The FBI soon joined the investigation and family and friends worked with detectives and agents in an urgent search for the missing girl.  Faced with conflicting witness reports and false leads, agents wouldn't stop until they found the girl, and the truth.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000091" start="20250620200800 +0000" stop="20250620210400 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>Beginning in summer of 1990, the bodies of several women began turning up in and around the city of Vienna, Austria. From an extensive investigation by the Viennese police, it was determined that these murders were the work of one sadistic predator.  Europe was dealing with a serial killer.  With no experience with this kind of predator, Viennese police turned to the FBI. FBI profilers were able to identify a suspect in the murders.  More ominously, they linked this same killer to murders committed in the United States.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000091" start="20250620210400 +0000" stop="20250620220100 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>In 1986, a small crime free Indiana town was turned inside out by the arrival of one dangerous stranger.
