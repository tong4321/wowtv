John Quiñones observes and comments on how ordinary people behave when they are confronted with dilemmas that require them either to take action or to walk by and mind their own business. Various scenarios are created that force people to make split-second -- and often surprising -- decisions, and variations of the situation (such as changing the genders, races or clothing of the people involved) are often featured to see if different reactions are elicited. Examples of situations on the show include a waitress being harassed by her boss, and a drunken valet trying to park cars.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20251115210000 +0000" stop="20251115213000 +0000"><title>ABC News Live Weekend: Saturday</title><desc>Breaking news coverage and live video.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20251115213000 +0000" stop="20251115220000 +0000"><title>Call to Serve</title><desc>Description Unavailable</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20251115220000 +0000" stop="20251115223000 +0000"><title>ABC News Live Weekend: Saturday</title><desc>Breaking news coverage and live video.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20251115223000 +0000" stop="20251115230000 +0000"><title>All Access With Linsey Davis</title><desc>A 30-minute interview franchise of ABC News Live "Prime With Linsey Davis" featuring candid conversations with celebrities, musicians, and newsmakers from across the cultural landscape.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20251115230000 +0000" stop="20251116010000 +0000"><title>20/20</title><desc>Award-winning program anchored by David Muir, featuring unforgettable, character-driven true crime mysteries, exclusive newsmaker interviews, hard-hitting investigative reports and in-depth coverage of high profile stories.</desc></programme><channel id="556174"><display-name>NBC News NOW</display-name><icon src="https://canvas-lb.tubitv.com/opts/SAA3cS-V06_Q3w==/dd770066-df10-4187-b8d5-c31d0b9c0a1f/CHgQeDoFMS4xLjhAAQ==" /></channel><programme channel="556174" start="20251114010000 +0000" stop="20251114020000 +0000"><title>Stay Tuned NOW With Gadi Schwartz</title><desc>A fresh look at the day's news, from the latest breaking news to what's on the horizon.</desc></programme><programme channel="556174" start="20251114020000 +0000" stop="20251114030000 +0000"><title>Top Story With Tom Llamas</title><desc>Reporting of breaking news and developing stories in real time.</desc></programme><programme channel="556174" start="20251114030000 +0000" stop="20251114033000 +0000"><title>NBC Nightly News With Tom Llamas</title><desc>Tom Llamas anchors the latest news, going beyond the headlines to see how lives are affected by the world around them.</desc></programme><programme channel="556174" start="20251114033000 +0000" stop="20251114043000 +0000"><title>Stay Tuned NOW With Gadi Schwartz</title><desc>A fresh look at the day's news, from the latest breaking news to what's on the horizon.</desc></programme><programme channel="556174" start="20251114043000 +0000" stop="20251114050000 +0000"><title>NBC Nightly News With Tom Llamas</title><desc>Tom Llamas anchors the latest news, going beyond the headlines to see how lives are affected by the world around them.</desc></programme><programme channel="556174" start="20251114050000 +0000" stop="20251114060000 +0000"><title>Top Story With Tom Llamas</title><desc>Reporting of breaking news and developing stories in real time.</desc></programme><programme channel="556174" start="20251114060000 +0000" stop="20251114070000 +0000"><title>Meet the Press NOW</title><desc>Looking at the key stories of the day with political newsmakers.</desc></programme><programme channel="556174" start="20251114070000 +0000" stop="20251114090000 +0000"><title>Dateline NBC</title><desc>An arrest is finally made five years after a mother of four disappeared while she was close to her apartment in Montana.</desc></programme><programme channel="556174" start="20251114090000 +0000" stop="20251114100000 +0000"><title>Dateline NBC</title><desc>The trial and murder conviction of Jodi Arias and the salacious relationship that ended in tragedy.</desc></programme><programme channel="556174" start="20251114100000 +0000" stop="20251114103000 +0000"><title>Early Today</title><desc>This early-morning news shows, that precedes local newscasts in many markets, covers overnight events, breaking domestic and international news as well as a preview of the day's anticipated events.

Al and Marg drove down to south Florida and met the owner – a young guy who had had big plans for his first boat but had been hit hard by Covid and needed the cash. When they drove up to the Bajío office with it in tow, everyone was stoked. Our first thought was, “wow, this thing is perfect.  It’s ready to go!” It’s pretty basic, but that’s what pangas are. All we need is a bamboo pole and we’re good.  When Jay showed up, he started making a list of a few things that we might need to add. A casting platform was kind of mandatory. A poling platform would be needed as well. A floor and a couple seats would make the ride easier on everybody. Some rod holders. A cooler. GPS. Lights…The list started growing. All of sudden, our little basic panga was in need some fairly big upgrades.Jay thought it would be helpful to find a local boat builder that would let us do the work in their facility.  His thinking was that we could make a trade. They give us space, teach us how to do boat building, let us use their tools and all of the materials. In return…well, we didn’t have a lot to offer. Some free shades? The pleasure of Jay’s company? Some love in the film we were making?We made some calls. No takers. More calls. Still no takers.Then one day, the local Chamber of Commerce decided to through us a welcome party. Super nice of them. We had a big crowd of local business owners show up. One was a woman named Sarah Dougherty. She and her husband own Dougherty Boatworks and Sōlace Boats.  “Whatever we can do help, just let us know.” Bingo! “Would you guys like to be in a film?”  What an amazing stroke of luck. Steven Dougherty is a legendary boat builder. He’s the guy other boat builders come to when they need advice. And he would be helping us build our panga!  Sweet!

Al and Marg drove down to south Florida and met the owner – a young guy who had had big plans for his first boat but had been hit hard by Covid and needed the cash. When they drove up to the Bajío office with it in tow, everyone was stoked. Our first thought was, “wow, this thing is perfect.  It’s ready to go!” It’s pretty basic, but that’s what pangas are. All we need is a bamboo pole and we’re good.  When Jay showed up, he started making a list of a few things that we might need to add. A casting platform was kind of mandatory. A poling platform would be needed as well. A floor and a couple seats would make the ride easier on everybody. Some rod holders. A cooler. GPS. Lights…The list started growing. All of sudden, our little basic panga was in need some fairly big upgrades.Jay thought it would be helpful to find a local boat builder that would let us do the work in their facility.  His thinking was that we could make a trade. They give us space, teach us how to do boat building, let us use their tools and all of the materials. In return…well, we didn’t have a lot to offer. Some free shades? The pleasure of Jay’s company? Some love in the film we were making?We made some calls. No takers. More calls. Still no takers.Then one day, the local Chamber of Commerce decided to through us a welcome party. Super nice of them. We had a big crowd of local business owners show up. One was a woman named Sarah Dougherty. She and her husband own Dougherty Boatworks and Sōlace Boats.  “Whatever we can do help, just let us know.” Bingo! “Would you guys like to be in a film?”  What an amazing stroke of luck. Steven Dougherty is a legendary boat builder. He’s the guy other boat builders come to when they need advice. And he would be helping us build our panga!  Sweet!
