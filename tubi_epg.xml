With little evidence and no suspects, agents were willing to try anything to find the violent perpetrators.  On April 11, 1986, agents conducting routine surveillance spotted the vehicle used in the bank robberies.  They attempted to arrest the two suspects in the car.

The next morning, when Frances Kirby is out for her morning jog, she notices the vintage car they were in up at the airfield, containing Simon Bright's dead body, with Laura nowhere to be seen. Confused, Detective Chief Inspector Barnaby and D.S. Jones can't work out whether it was a suicide pact or murder. Furthermore, they've got to find Miss Sharp and their investigation leads them to linking Simon and Laura with the villagers of Morton Fendle, who met at Elaine Trim's dancing classes. Eventually, the Barnaby family plus Jones make it to a 40s style dance night at the village hall before more villagers start turning up dead.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20250831080000 +0000" stop="20250831100000 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>When Faith Alexander arrives in Midsomer County to meet her long-lost uncle Rex Masters, she gets a shock - Rex's staff had been told that she was dead. Things become even more complex when Rex's body is found in a nearby river, bearing wounds that suggest he was murdered. Barnaby and Jones are soon on the case, trying to establish who would have wanted the elderly man dead. Several people soon come forward with multiple wills, which confuse the matter, but when two more people, close friends of Rex, are also murdered, the investigation raises question on the motive, leading Barnaby to wonder if it was down to finances, passion, or something from Rex's past.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20250831100000 +0000" stop="20250831110000 +0000"><title>Murdoch Mysteries</title><desc>Murdoch investigates a man's murder outside a burlesque show performed by Crabtree's former paramour Nina Bloom.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20250831110000 +0000" stop="20250831120000 +0000"><title>Murdoch Mysteries</title><desc>After a motorcycle enthusiast dies, Murdoch's investigation is aided by mechanics William Harley and Arthur Davidson.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20250831120000 +0000" stop="20250831130000 +0000"><title>Murdoch Mysteries</title><desc>While investigating a murder in a tight-lipped Mennonite colony, Murdoch and Ogden don plain clothing and go under cover.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20250831130000 +0000" stop="20250831140000 +0000"><title>Murdoch Mysteries</title><desc>Hours before a clandestine visit by President Taft, Murdoch is entangled by Terence Meyers in an experiment gone wrong.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20250831140000 +0000" stop="20250831150000 +0000"><title>Murdoch Mysteries</title><desc>Murdoch investigates the brutal on-camera murder of an actress during the filming of a movie about the clown killer.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20250831150000 +0000" stop="20250831160000 +0000"><title>Murdoch Mysteries</title><desc>Honeymooning in England, Crabtree and Effie find a dead hotel guest while Murdoch investigates an apparent suicide.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20250831160000 +0000" stop="20250831170000 +0000"><title>Murdoch Mysteries</title><desc>As Murdoch investigates the murder of an elite athlete who gets impaled by a javelin, Hart and Arthur plot her father's demise.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20250831170000 +0000" stop="20250831180000 +0000"><title>Murdoch Mysteries</title><desc>The sudden death of a key witness leaves Murdoch physically unsettled.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20250831180000 +0000" stop="20250831190000 +0000"><title>Murdoch Mysteries</title><desc>Higgins enlists Watts help after he messes up the courier delivery of a horse statue for some very dangerous thugs.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20250831190000 +0000" stop="20250831200000 +0000"><title>Murdoch Mysteries</title><desc>Murdoch must prove Brackenreid's innocence when he's framed for murder by a vengeful foe.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20250831200000 +0000" stop="20250831210000 +0000"><title>Magnum P.I.</title><desc>Katsumoto's hearing date has arrived, and he will learn if his career in law enforcement is over for good or not; Magnum and Higgins are hired to investigate a man their client believes committed murder; Rick's suspicions grow on their relationship.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20250831210000 +0000" stop="20250831220000 +0000"><title>Magnum P.I.</title><desc>Magnum and Higgins investigate the robbery of an elderly man suffering from Alzheimer's; the ohana tries to help TC overcome a past trauma.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20250831220000 +0000" stop="20250831230000 +0000"><title>Magnum P.I.</title><desc>Magnum and Rick make a shocking discovery in the Capt.
