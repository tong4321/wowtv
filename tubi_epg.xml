But before we can hit the road, we’ve got some work to do.The bus…it needs a new motor and maybe some other stuff (TBD) that’s been hiding under 40 years of crust and crud…The boat, it needs some fiberglass work. A casting platform and floor would be cool…maybe a paint job.And Jay, well his gear is pretty shot, and his normally ripped physique has been obscured under some COVID poundage he acquired over the past year or so…And maybe a pedicure and haircut are in order before stepping in front of the camera…First, the bus. A little interior decorating perhaps. The 14 seats built for preschoolers don’t quite accommodate over-sized fishing dudes. And, come to find out, there are no rod racks. No bar. No stereo. No beds. No fly-tying stations. And no beer fridge.

Because of a combination of threats, from pollution to climate change, the densely populated area’s fish populations are dwindling – but locals are educating themselves on ways to make change. In this beautifully photographed award-winning film, we get a rare glimpse into life on the lake while learning how a dedicated conservation group is combatting plastic pollution.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20251107234829 +0000" stop="20251108000019 +0000"><title>Rivers are Life</title><desc>At age seven, Cash “The Conservation Kid” Daniels began leading cleanups along the Tennessee River in his hometown, Chattanooga.
