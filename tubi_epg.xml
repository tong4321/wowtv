Confused, Detective Chief Inspector Barnaby and D.S. Jones can't work out whether it was a suicide pact or murder. Furthermore, they've got to find Miss Sharp and their investigation leads them to linking Simon and Laura with the villagers of Morton Fendle, who met at Elaine Trim's dancing classes.

Barnaby and Jones are soon on the case, trying to establish who would have wanted the elderly man dead.

During their opening performance, the band's singer, Mimi (Suzi Quatro), falls to the ground dead - electrocuted by a wire that had been run through the microphone stand. Barnaby and Jones soon find the rest of the band could be targets, and when another is killed, questions are raised as to whether former band member, Ginger Foxton, who went missing for 30 years and is presumed dead, is still at large.

In June 1985, the terrorist and his four accomplices hijacked Royal Jordanian flight #405 shortly before take off in Beirut, Lebanon. On board were American citizens, a professor and his teen son. The FBI opened a criminal investigation and worked with various other government agencies to form Operation Goldenrod, a task force specifically charged with bringing the terrorist to justice in 1989.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000091" start="20251202193900 +0000" stop="20251202203700 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>In October 1995, a South Carolina family was taken hostage as part of an elaborately planned bank robbery.  Local police quickly identified two of the perpetrators, but the criminal mastermind proved more elusive.  After his escape from custody, authorities began to suspect the fugitive of involvement in a series of bank robberies up and down the east coast, and the FBI remained on his trail, hoping to catch him before he took more hostages.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000091" start="20251202203700 +0000" stop="20251202213300 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>In 1990 and 1991, Chicago police and the FBI were on the trail of a bank robber whose holdups were becoming increasingly violent.  The criminal consistently used stolen Japanese cars to carry out the robberies, so authorities hoped to identify him by tracking vehicle thefts.  When they finally located the man known as the bearded bandit, they learned that he did not work alone and he had made a pact never to surrender.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000091" start="20251202213300 +0000" stop="20251202223000 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>In the 1970's, Otpor, a violent arm of the Croatian National Resistance commits terroristic acts against non-supportive Croatians living in the U.S.  With the help of an informant, the FBI is able to apprehend, arrest and convict members of the group for crimes ranging from conspiracy and extortion to murder.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000091" start="20251202223000 +0000" stop="20251202232600 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>In the summer of 1999, Texas was terrorized by a brutal serial killer who traveled by train.  The FBI assembled a task force to gather information about the dangerous drifter and create a profile that would help locate him.
