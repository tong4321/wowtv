Various scenarios are created that force people to make split-second -- and often surprising -- decisions, and variations of the situation (such as changing the genders, races or clothing of the people involved) are often featured to see if different reactions are elicited. Examples of situations on the show include a waitress being harassed by her boss, and a drunken valet trying to park cars.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20250818030000 +0000" stop="20250818033000 +0000"><title>ABC World News Tonight With David Muir</title><desc>The latest news from America, as reported by the ABC television network.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20250818033000 +0000" stop="20250818040000 +0000"><title>ABC World News Tonight With David Muir</title><desc>The latest news from America, as reported by the ABC television network.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20250818040000 +0000" stop="20250818060000 +0000"><title>20/20</title><desc>Award-winning program anchored by David Muir, featuring unforgettable, character-driven true crime mysteries, exclusive newsmaker interviews, hard-hitting investigative reports and in-depth coverage of high profile stories.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20250818060000 +0000" stop="20250818063000 +0000"><title>ABC World News Now</title><desc>Up-to-date information on current events and news from around the world, airing in the overnight hours.

But when Sonia Woodley is stabbed in the churchyard two years after the death of her abusive husband Gerald, Barnaby and Jones investigate, trying to work out who killed her. It soon becomes clear someone took a pair of tailor scissors to do the deed, but who amongst the villagers could have done so, is unclear, and the investigation is complicated, when the pair learn the local Anglican priest, the parish vicar, had received a letter from Sonia. When he himself is killed, the pair believe something in the letter may be key to solving the mystery.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20250819002000 +0000" stop="20250819020500 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>Barnaby is not convinced about Mayor David Hicks' plans to revive an annual trip to Brighton, suspecting his proposal to buy coastal land there, is rather a fraudulent scheme. Naturally, he joins the trip, but during their time in Brighton, a hated property developer (Tim McInnerny) is beheaded on a ghost house ride, prompting Barnaby to team up with his cousin to determine whether the developer's renters, the mayor, a gloomy reverend (Mark Gatiss), or the lady of a large estate are responsible, and soon discovers a hotbed of jealously, debt, lies and more, conceal a far darker secret.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20250819020500 +0000" stop="20250819035000 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>Ford Florey is a town with a Wild West Society and many grudges. During a Wild West show at the local faire, the witch on the 'Dunk the Witch' stall is well and truly dunked but laughter soon turns to horror when she doesn't get up and the water in the tank starts to turn red. Barnaby and Jones need to be quick on the draw to track down the murderer, and soon begin to wonder whether a dispute over land was the motive, or something far more sinister, especially when more people are killed, with methods linked to the Wild West.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20250819035000 +0000" stop="20250819053500 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>On a dark night in the village of March Magna, Barnaby's wife Joyce swerves her car and narrowly misses a shadowy figure in the road - or so she thinks, when later that night a body is discovered in the old cemetery. The victim was a member of the council who was strange and weird, but someone seemed to have quite a grudge on him, and so Barnaby and Jones delve into his background, and the village, attempting to determine who might have wanted him dead, finding ghosts, grudges, and more beneath the village's surface.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20250819053500 +0000" stop="20250819072000 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>Piano student Zoe Stock has won a place at the Devington Manor Winter School led by internationally renowned musician, Sir Michael Fielding (James Fox).

When Barnaby and Jones start investigating the possible drowning, they discover unsavoury connections to the past that could prove lethal 20 years later, especially when someone attempts to kill. It isn't long, before murder does occur, and the detectives attempt to fathom what occurred in the drowning, and the present day murders.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20250819072000 +0000" stop="20250819090400 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>When Midsomer Morchard's very own boxer, John Kinsella, wins a world title in New York, the success seems to be a joyous time for all, until murder rears its ugly head.

Meanwhile Kinsella's trainer Teddy Molloy (Phil Daniels) has his own hidden agenda. When a re-enactment of a Victorian boxing match gets heated, and Kinsella's manager is found dead in his home's gym, the pair attempt to determine who is responsible, although Barnaby's judgement seems to be clouded on this one.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20250819090400 +0000" stop="20250819104900 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>A planning dispute turns to murder, after a leading light in the Midsomer Conservation Society suspects her neighbours are involved in a money-making development scam.

Using the same modus operandi, the two men took hostages and emptied bank vaults across the Midwest.  After the criminals escaped from police custody, FBI agents familiar with the bandits believed that they would attempt a grand-scale heist.  By conducting surveillance on known associates of the criminals, authorities tried to anticipate the next target.</desc></programme><programme channel="682630" start="20250818030000 +0000" stop="20250818040000 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>In 1991, the Safe Streets Task Force, a joint FBI / Washington D.C.

FBI and local police struggled to find answers in the cryptic message so they could find the kidnapper and retrieve the victim before her time ran out. Solving the crime required the keen insight of a criminal profiler and the perseverance of a family, local authorities, and the FBI.</desc></programme><programme channel="682630" start="20250818050000 +0000" stop="20250818060000 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>In June of 2000, two gunmen rob a Seattle, WA bank, and flee on foot as officers chase them.
