When a local solicitor is found dead by his assistant and Kinsella's manager, Barnaby attempts to determine what is going on, and soon discover issues with inheritance, affairs, anger, and gambling to make matters difficult. Meanwhile Kinsella's trainer Teddy Molloy (Phil Daniels) has his own hidden agenda. When a re-enactment of a Victorian boxing match gets heated, and Kinsella's manager is found dead in his home's gym, the pair attempt to determine who is responsible, although Barnaby's judgement seems to be clouded on this one.</desc></programme><channel id="671073"><display-name>Unsolved Mysteries</display-name><icon src="https://canvas-lb.tubitv.com/opts/5DVrF33Bfks10w==/864892f9-3ab0-4950-9f8b-189ec2d92c20/CHgQeDoFMS4xLjhAAQ==" /></channel><programme channel="671073" start="20251008120400 +0000" stop="20251008130000 +0000"><title>Unsolved Mysteries With Robert Stack</title><desc>This episode includes: Oklahoma City Rescuers, UD: Baby Given Away, Carolina Cop Killer &amp; UD, Vince Foster and Crime Novelist.</desc></programme><programme channel="671073" start="20251008130000 +0000" stop="20251008135600 +0000"><title>Unsolved Mysteries With Robert Stack</title><desc>This episode includes: Missing Rock Star &amp; UD, UD: Wandering Fishman, St. Louis Custody Killing &amp; UD, Animal Therapist, Who Do Voodoo? and Molnar Heir &amp; UD.</desc></programme><programme channel="671073" start="20251008135600 +0000" stop="20251008145100 +0000"><title>Unsolved Mysteries With Robert Stack</title><desc>Jesse James Hollywood and update; Rider Down and update; Bad Dad; Picture Kristen Gone.</desc></programme><programme channel="671073" start="20251008145100 +0000" stop="20251008154500 +0000"><title>Misterios Sin Revolver</title><desc>Este episodio incluye: Los Sue√±os Se Hacen Realidad, El Asesino de New Orleans, Alivio C√≥mico &amp; Actualizaci√≥n y El M√©todo J.D. &amp; Actualizaci√≥n.</desc></programme><programme channel="671073" start="20251008154500 +0000" stop="20251008164400 +0000"><title>Unsolved Mysteries With Robert Stack</title><desc>This episode includes: RFK Pix &amp; UD, Lady in Black, Vigilante and Shelly Loved Horses.</desc></programme><programme channel="671073" start="20251008164400 +0000" stop="20251008174100 +0000"><title>Unsolved Mysteries With Robert Stack</title><desc>An exploration of Bigfoot II, threats and harassment, murder by arson, and more.</desc></programme><programme channel="671073" start="20251008174100 +0000" stop="20251008184200 +0000"><title>Unsolved Mysteries With Robert Stack</title><desc>This episode includes: Ice Woman, Airline Employee Murder, Silicon Valley Hit, Florida Crime Spree &amp; UD and Elvis, The Twinless Twin.</desc></programme><programme channel="671073" start="20251008184200 +0000" stop="20251008193700 +0000"><title>Unsolved Mysteries With Robert Stack</title><desc>This episode includes: Mummy's Curse, Cabbie Bomber, Terrorized Teen and Amtrak Sabotage.</desc></programme><programme channel="671073" start="20251008193700 +0000" stop="20251008204200 +0000"><title>Unsolved Mysteries With Robert Stack</title><desc>This episode includes: Forklift Mystery &amp; UD, Unicorn's Secret &amp; UD, Where's Jim?, Ohio Video Robbery and Grace's Ghost.</desc></programme><programme channel="671073" start="20251008204200 +0000" stop="20251008214300 +0000"><title>Unsolved Mysteries With Robert Stack</title><desc>This episode includes: Oklahoma City Rescuers, UD: Baby Given Away, Carolina Cop Killer &amp; UD, Vince Foster and Crime Novelist.</desc></programme><programme channel="671073" start="20251008214300 +0000" stop="20251008224000 +0000"><title>Misterios Sin Revolver</title><desc>Este episodio incluye: El Fugitivo Tira Bombas (Partes 1 &amp; 2) &amp; Actualizaci√≥n, Actualizaci√≥n: Asesino del Seguro Social, Mona Lisa, ¬øEst√° Muerta Doreen?
