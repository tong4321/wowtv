Pro Wrestler Mikey takes on Wipeout Australias very own Tom Cruise. Its neck and neck through the qualifier which this week includes a real Mission Impossible, Dirty Balls. The trash talk is as fierce as the competition and continues to the Wipeout Zone with the winner taking not only the $20,000 but also the glory. Australia is also introduced to a new kind of “violent love”, the Fight Hug.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20250627011225 +0000" stop="20250627020743 +0000"><title>Wipeout Australia</title><desc>This week contestants on Wipeout Australia are bought undone by a seemingly simple obstacle on the Qualifier, the Slippery Stairs. It’s all in the name really, an innocent set of stairs, covered in Wipeout Crash cream. Its up the way and down the way for all and sundry. The lucky 12 that move through, battle it out with a giant toothbrush Sweeper. ‘Nat with the Tats’ and Renee ‘Lets get physical’ move through to the Dreadmill, flying the banner for the ladies. Look out for Scotty Six Toes at the Big Balls and get the ear plugs ready as you meet Herr Chris. It’s a colourful week with leotards, laughs and lots of ladies.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20250627020743 +0000" stop="20250627032049 +0000"><title>Total Wipeout</title><desc>This is the first 'Celebrity Special' of the season.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20250627032049 +0000" stop="20250627043357 +0000"><title>Total Wipeout</title><desc>Time again for the world of celebrity to take on the most outrageous obstacle course in the name of charity.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20250627043357 +0000" stop="20250627054458 +0000"><title>Total Wipeout</title><desc>Twenty contestants take on one of television's largest and most extreme obstacle courses.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20250627054458 +0000" stop="20250627065237 +0000"><title>Total Wipeout</title><desc>In this episode, contestants face different games like The Qualifier and The Dizzy Dummies.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20250627065237 +0000" stop="20250627080745 +0000"><title>101 Ways to Leave a Gameshow</title><desc>Steve Jones hosts the series where contestants are ejected in the most nerve-wracking means ever seen on TV.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20250627080745 +0000" stop="20250627092256 +0000"><title>101 Ways to Leave a Gameshow</title><desc>Contestants are ejected from the show in the craziest and most outrageous ways possible.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20250627092256 +0000" stop="20250627103800 +0000"><title>101 Ways to Leave a Gameshow</title><desc>More unsuspecting contestants, all competing for a 10k pound prize, are dropped, fired and dragged screaming.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20250627103800 +0000" stop="20250627115310 +0000"><title>101 Ways to Leave a Gameshow</title><desc>Contestants are ejected from the show in the craziest and most outrageous ways possible.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20250627115310 +0000" stop="20250627130821 +0000"><title>101 Ways to Leave a Gameshow</title><desc>Steve Jones hosts the series where contestants are ejected in the craziest ways possible.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20250627130821 +0000" stop="20250627142336 +0000"><title>101 Ways to Leave a Gameshow</title><desc>Steve Jones hosts the series where contestants are ejected in the most nerve-wracking means ever seen on TV.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20250627142336 +0000" stop="20250627153844 +0000"><title>101 Ways to Leave a Gameshow</title><desc>Steve Jones hosts the series where contestants are ejected in the most nerve-wracking means ever seen on TV.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20250627153844 +0000" stop="20250627165359 +0000"><title>101 Ways to Leave a Gameshow</title><desc>Steve Jones hosts the series where contestants are ejected in the most nerve-wracking means ever seen on TV.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20250627165359 +0000" stop="20250627175000 +0000"><title>Wipeout Canada</title><desc>20 ordinary Canadians will compete in the world’s largest most extreme obstacle course designed to provide the most spills, thrills and fantastic fumbles ever seen on television.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20250627175000 +0000" stop="20250627184601 +0000"><title>Wipeout Canada</title><desc>Wipeout Canada brings you a countdown of the season's most memorable moments with never-before-seen footage, extended scenes and live interviews with some of the most popular contestants.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20250627184601 +0000" stop="20250627195926 +0000"><title>Total Wipeout</title><desc>In this episode, twenty intrepid contestants take on four gruelling obstacles.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20250627195926 +0000" stop="20250627211226 +0000"><title>Total Wipeout</title><desc>This is the last episode of the season and the 8 previous winners compete to be the Champion of Champions.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20250627211226 +0000" stop="20250627222735 +0000"><title>101 Ways to Leave a Gameshow</title><desc>Steve Jones hosts the series where contestants are ejected in the most nerve-wracking means ever seen on TV.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20250627222735 +0000" stop="20250627232026 +0000"><title>Wipeout Australia</title><desc>It’s Sitcom Central on Wipeout Australia with the Odd Couple, starring World’s Strongest Dwarf, David Clarke and Gentle Giant, Tim Watts.
