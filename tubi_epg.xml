As always the adventure will end with a feast, right back in Chintan’s kitchen.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20251130063001 +0000" stop="20251130070014 +0000"><title>200</title><desc>Follow Team200’s crew of traditional archers as they chase bigwhitetails in Canada!</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20251130070014 +0000" stop="20251130073002 +0000"><title>200</title><desc>Team200 partners with Asio Gear this year and follows previousTeam200 Prostaffer and owner of Asio Joe Miles, through his 2022season as he chases big whitetails across the midwest andMexico!</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20251130073002 +0000" stop="20251130080002 +0000"><title>200</title><desc>Tarif Alkhatibs is new to Team200, but no stranger to killing someof the biggest free range whitetails in his home state of Texas –including the state record typical!</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20251130080002 +0000" stop="20251130083002 +0000"><title>Saltwater Experience</title><desc>Captains Tom Rowland and Rich Tudor are joined by Key West guide Nick LaBadie, a talented guide with a special knack for finding permit on the Key West flats.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20251130083002 +0000" stop="20251130090001 +0000"><title>Saltwater Experience</title><desc>Captains Tom Rowland and Rich Tudor are joined by New York Cop Mike Counihan, who brings his passion for fitness and fishing along as the crew take on sharks in the Middle Florida Keys flats.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20251130090001 +0000" stop="20251130093000 +0000"><title>Saltwater Experience</title><desc>Captains Tom Rowland and Rich Tudor rise early for a full day of adventure in the Keys, rocking the sunrise for baby tarpon, scoring on some mid-day permit, and watching the sun go down in search for big tarpon.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20251130093000 +0000" stop="20251130100000 +0000"><title>saltwater experience</title><desc>Captains Tom Rowland and Rich Tudor are joined by Florida Keys guide Brandon Vargas, who leads them off the shore Duck Key to an exciting batch of offshore permit.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20251130100000 +0000" stop="20251130103015 +0000"><title>Saltwater Experience</title><desc>Captains Tom Rowland and Rich Tudor are joined by Florida Keys guide Brandon Vargas, as they continue from an earlier flurry of offshore permit catches to a variety of fun offshore targets.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20251130103015 +0000" stop="20251130110000 +0000"><title>Saltwater Experience</title><desc>Captains Tom Rowland and Rich Tudor head to the Everglades for whatever may come, and that turns out to be some exciting action near the mangroves with snook and baby tarpon.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20251130110000 +0000" stop="20251130113001 +0000"><title>Reel Animals</title><desc>Mike and Ozzy Fish shallow water for redfish snook and trout on the flats of Captiva.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20251130113001 +0000" stop="20251130120001 +0000"><title>Sportsman's Journal</title><desc>Tyler and Sara hunt down muskies on a new Island on Lake of the Woods with an old feel!</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20251130120001 +0000" stop="20251130123001 +0000"><title>Realtree Road Trips</title><desc>After 3 years, Tyler kills “Stomper,Jr.” and he just might be the new Louisiana state record buck.

Anne Merrick tells them about Winyard, a tumbledown cottage in the woods, might be for sale. At the estate agents they are told the house is not yet available for viewing. Later that evening they find the house on their own. However, Caroline has read up on the cottage's haunted reputation and only reluctantly explores it with Peter.
