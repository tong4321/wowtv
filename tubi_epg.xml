Ranging from six to twelve-plus inches in length and weighing two to sixteen ounces, these baits require a quiver of specialized equipment and a different mindset. The adage "big bait, big fish" is the guiding principle, firmly centered on catching the biggest bass in the lake, armed with the largest baits from your tackle box.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20260113150000 +0000" stop="20260113153002 +0000"><title>Goin' Coastal</title><desc>Fishing with the Mayor Description: Join the Major of destin as he ventures into the world of coastal fishing, leaving the city behind for a day of fun and unexpected challenges.

Yet, within this pursuit lies a distinct niche: trophy hunting via swimbait fishing. Unlike traditional baits, swimbaits stand out in their uniqueness within an angler's arsenal. Ranging from six to twelve-plus inches in length and weighing two to sixteen ounces, these baits require a quiver of specialized equipment and a different mindset. The adage "big bait, big fish" is the guiding principle, firmly centered on catching the biggest bass in the lake, armed with the largest baits from your tackle box.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20260113150000 +0000" stop="20260113153002 +0000"><title>Goin' Coastal</title><desc>Fishing with the Mayor Description: Join the Major of destin as he ventures into the world of coastal fishing, leaving the city behind for a day of fun and unexpected challenges.

Led by Cory Redwine, Conservation Director of Project SeaSafe, this is the 4th Annual Clean Water Collective and it’s bigger than ever. This time, we’re in Grant, Florida, where 4 million clams are being released into the Indian River Lagoon, paired with the planting of thousands of mangroves, oyster work by CCA and trash clean ups to help restore one of Florida’s most critical ecosystems. But it’s not just about hard work—it’s about connection. With local captains, fishing legends, and the Local Knowledge crew on hand, we hit the water to show why this place is worth fighting for. From clam drops by drone, to in-water mangrove planting, to monster snook catches, this is hands-on conservation at its best. This two-part series kicks off with action, heart, and the kind of hope only a healthy waterway can bring. Don’t miss Part 1—where conservation meets community and everyone gets their hands wet.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20260113183000 +0000" stop="20260113190000 +0000"><title>Local Knowledge</title><desc>As part of this year's Star brite Sea Safe event, we hit the water to experience some of the incredible fishing the Indian River Lagoon has to offer. For Rush, that meant some serious bow time with close friend Alex Hughey - on the hunt for some of the biggest snook we've ever encountered. The bite wasn't easy, but that didn't stop Rush from smashing his personal best - not once, but twice - in one unforgettable day on the water. Don't miss this action-packed episode of the Sea Safe adventure from beautiful Sebastian, Florida!</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20260113190000 +0000" stop="20260113193000 +0000"><title>Local Knowledge</title><desc>Join Rush and his good friend Anthony Solmo for an epic day of fishing in the stunning waters of Key West, Florida! Leaving the Odyssea at the dock, they hop on a bay boat outfitted with a trolling motor for the ultimate inshore adventure.

With reports of hot bites and fish moving in, the crew faces a classic Southern California dilemma — chase big yellowtail around the Coronado Islands or head north in search of bluefin tuna. The options are plenty, the challenges are real, and that’s exactly what keeps fishing in SoCal so exciting.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20260113200001 +0000" stop="20260113203000 +0000"><title>Saltwater Experience</title><desc>Captains Tom Rowland and Rich Tudor meet up with Captain Nick LaBadie at Big Pine Key for an action packed day on the flats chasing tarpon, bonefish and permit for the elusive grand slam.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20260113203000 +0000" stop="20260113210001 +0000"><title>TRP</title><desc>Captains Tom Rowland and Rich Tudor run from Hawks Cay Resort up to Islamorada on a windy day to fish under the mangroves for Goliath grouper.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20260113210001 +0000" stop="20260113213000 +0000"><title>TRP</title><desc>Captains Tom Rowland and Rich Tudor join Captain Bryson Shaaber to fish the channels around Key West targeting big spring tarpon with live pinfish.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20260113213000 +0000" stop="20260113220002 +0000"><title>Saltwater Experience</title><desc>Captains Tom Rowland and Rich Tudor launch out of Key Largo and fish their way up a creek filled with monsters.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20260113220002 +0000" stop="20260113223000 +0000"><title>Saltwater Experience</title><desc>Captains Tom Rowland and Rich Tudor are joined by Captain Tony Young for a day of offshore fishing and free diving out of Islamorada.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20260113223000 +0000" stop="20260113230001 +0000"><title>Saltwater Experience</title><desc>Captains Tom Rowland and Rich Tudor head deep into the Everglades to target snook in the murky waters of Lake Ingraham.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20260113230001 +0000" stop="20260113233001 +0000"><title>Captain's Log</title><desc>From South Florida to North West Central Florida, Capt.
