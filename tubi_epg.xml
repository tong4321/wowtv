The project supports sturgeon population recovery through egg collection, hatchery programs, and community events like Port Huron’s Sturgeon Fest, organized by the Friends of the St. Clair River. Every year since its inception in 2012, Sturgeon Fest has released young sturgeon back into the wild, contributing to the unique species' resurgence in the Great Lakes region. This year, the Rivers are Life team helped tag two juvenile sturgeons, which made their debut in the popular festival's touch tank before release.</desc></programme><channel id="400000065"><display-name>Top Gear</display-name><icon src="https://canvas-lb.tubitv.com/opts/g_SN11NtWr_adw==/45d06aa3-8a80-4864-a7b0-25a606d26be3/CHgQeDoFMS4xLjhAAQ==" /></channel><programme channel="400000065" start="20251211010908 +0000" stop="20251211020655 +0000"><title>Top Gear UK: Best Of</title><desc>James test drives the world's most luxurious car: the Rolls Royce Phantom Drophead Coupe.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000065" start="20251211020655 +0000" stop="20251211031446 +0000"><title>Top Gear UK: Best Of</title><desc>Another choice compilation of horsepower, tire smoke and calamity.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000065" start="20251211031446 +0000" stop="20251211042156 +0000"><title>Top Gear UK: Best Of</title><desc>Another choice compilation of horsepower, tire smoke and calamity.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000065" start="20251211042156 +0000" stop="20251211052946 +0000"><title>Top Gear UK: Best Of</title><desc>Another choice compilation of horsepower, tire smoke and calamity.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000065" start="20251211052946 +0000" stop="20251211062323 +0000"><title>Top Gear: Winter Blunderland</title><desc>Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May present their best winter themed challenges - Part 1.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000065" start="20251211062323 +0000" stop="20251211071828 +0000"><title>Top Gear: Winter Blunderland</title><desc>Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May present their best winter themed challenges - Part 1.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000065" start="20251211071828 +0000" stop="20251211081615 +0000"><title>Top Gear: Winter Blunderland</title><desc>Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May present their best winter themed challenges - Part 1.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000065" start="20251211081615 +0000" stop="20251211092534 +0000"><title>Top Gear UK: Winter Olympics Special</title><desc>The team hit Norway and attempt winter Olympic events, but with cars.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000065" start="20251211092534 +0000" stop="20251211101841 +0000"><title>Top Gear: Winter Blunderland</title><desc>Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May present their best winter themed challenges - Part 1.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000065" start="20251211101841 +0000" stop="20251211111146 +0000"><title>Top Gear: Winter Blunderland</title><desc>Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May present their best winter themed challenges - Part 1.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000065" start="20251211111146 +0000" stop="20251211120903 +0000"><title>Top Gear: Winter Blunderland</title><desc>Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May present their best winter themed challenges - Part 1.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000065" start="20251211120903 +0000" stop="20251211131622 +0000"><title>Top Gear UK: Winter Olympics Special</title><desc>The team hit Norway and attempt winter Olympic events, but with cars.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000065" start="20251211131622 +0000" stop="20251211142635 +0000"><title>Top Gear UK: Patagonia Special</title><desc>The lads take V8-engined sports cars on a gruelling journey through the spectacular landscapes of Patagonia.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000065" start="20251211142635 +0000" stop="20251211153738 +0000"><title>Top Gear UK: Patagonia Special</title><desc>The team continue their quest to take three V8-engined sports cars on an epic journey.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000065" start="20251211153738 +0000" stop="20251211163949 +0000"><title>Top Gear UK: Polar Special</title><desc>The Top Gear team attempt to race from Northern Canada to the North Pole, 450 miles away.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000065" start="20251211163949 +0000" stop="20251211174040 +0000"><title>Top Gear UK</title><desc>The Vauxhall Astra leaves Jeremy eating more than just his words!
