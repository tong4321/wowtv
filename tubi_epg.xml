With 20 species on the list, Mark is now hunting ducks below the equator as they migrate North to warmer weather.

A year has passed since Mark conquered the North America Waterfowl Slam. During the off-season, and with Covid just a memory, his focus shifted to thoughts of South America and the waterfowl species that it holds. After a few months of research and talking with the experts at Worldwide Trophy Adventures, he laid out the plan to attempt the South America slam in 2022. With 20 species on the list, Mark is now hunting ducks below the equator as they migrate North to warmer weather. Enjoy this first installment of a 9 episode series that showcases his new quest for another single-season waterfowl slam.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20250812033000 +0000" stop="20250812040012 +0000"><title>Louisiana Catch and Cook</title><desc>We're BACK in Lafitte continuing our adventure in Jefferson Parish.

Now, Hammer must keep everyone safe and stop the criminals, all without his gun.</desc></programme><programme channel="682634" start="20250812100000 +0000" stop="20250812110000 +0000"><title>NCIS: Los Angeles</title><desc>When an NCIS mission to protect a compromised undercover agent goes completely sideways, the agents are individually interrogated to find out what really happened; Kilbride must make a difficult decision.</desc></programme><programme channel="682634" start="20250812110000 +0000" stop="20250812120000 +0000"><title>NCIS: Los Angeles</title><desc>Sam negotiates and Rountree goes under cover, when a man takes a busload of hostages and threatens to blow it up unless his daughter's war crimes are posthumously cleared.</desc></programme><programme channel="682634" start="20250812120000 +0000" stop="20250812130000 +0000"><title>NCIS: Los Angeles</title><desc>NCIS investigates the apparent suicide of a Navy intelligence officer who leapt to his death after taking LSD; while Kensi is away, Deeks makes plans to redo the backyard without her input.</desc></programme><programme channel="682634" start="20250812130000 +0000" stop="20250812140000 +0000"><title>NCIS: Los Angeles</title><desc>The NCIS team helps a U.S. ambassador search for her missing daughter; agent Aliyah De León returns to support the team with the case.</desc></programme><programme channel="682634" start="20250812140000 +0000" stop="20250812150000 +0000"><title>NCIS: Los Angeles</title><desc>When a civilian scientist working with the marines is killed and her advanced radar technology stolen, the team must scramble to find the missing technology and the culprit.</desc></programme><programme channel="682634" start="20250812150000 +0000" stop="20250812160000 +0000"><title>Chicago Fire</title><desc>Citing a need for improvement, Chief Anderson reassigns members of 51 to other firehouses, leaving the crew members to make the best of their respective new situations; Severide struggles with an important decision.</desc></programme><programme channel="682634" start="20250812160000 +0000" stop="20250812170000 +0000"><title>Chicago Fire</title><desc>Members of the fire and rescue squads become hostages when a group of armed gang members invades and assumes control over Firehouse 51 during a turf war.</desc></programme><programme channel="682634" start="20250812170000 +0000" stop="20250812180000 +0000"><title>Chicago Fire</title><desc>A series of similar car accidents raises suspicion that someone may be targeting innocent people; Severide tries to make Anna feel welcome in her new Chicago surroundings; a persistent constituent asks for Alderman Casey's help in resolving an issue.</desc></programme><programme channel="682634" start="20250812180000 +0000" stop="20250812190000 +0000"><title>Chicago Fire</title><desc>Casey discovers a new crack house on the block that's harboring a female junkie; a new trainee gets Dawson and Brett into trouble; Severide gets an unexpected visit from his father.</desc></programme><programme channel="682634" start="20250812190000 +0000" stop="20250812200000 +0000"><title>Chicago Fire</title><desc>Casey reunites with a former colleague; Dawson and Brett serve their time in retraining; Severide tries to fix what's going on with Anna.</desc></programme><programme channel="682634" start="20250812200000 +0000" stop="20250812210000 +0000"><title>Chicago Fire</title><desc>Casey takes extreme measures to help his friend Kannell; Severide helps an old widow come to terms with letting go; Otis and Cruz find a new roommate.</desc></programme><programme channel="682634" start="20250812210000 +0000" stop="20250812220000 +0000"><title>Chicago Fire</title><desc>Mouch offers to help when an off-duty incident puts Cruz in a bad spot; Casey takes on a powerful politician; Lt.
