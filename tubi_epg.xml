A feature length film created to help inspire everyday people through real life parables and narrations from recognizable spiritual figureheads. Presented as a series of short vignettes recorded in an intimate, close-cropped setting to engage the viewer as if he or she is soul seeking wisdom at the foot of a sage. Weaving the journey and anecdotes of some of the most prolific high profile ministers, evangelists and church leaders of the 21st Century, The Scroll took three years to complete, interviewing over 50 of the U.S.'s most progressive and revered Spiritual Leaders.</desc></programme><programme channel="692087" start="20250908121000 +0000" stop="20250908133700 +0000"><title>Hopetown</title><desc>An ex Golden Glove champion attempts to fix his relationship with his sister.</desc></programme><programme channel="692087" start="20250908133700 +0000" stop="20250908153700 +0000"><title>Life of a King</title><desc>A former felon looking for redemption tries to steer inner-city kids away from crime by forming an unconventional chess club in Washington, DC.</desc></programme><programme channel="692087" start="20250908153700 +0000" stop="20250908171200 +0000"><title>The Love We Had</title><desc>After one decision destroys the life of a young couple, it continues to ruin their other relationships and everything they hold sacred.</desc></programme><programme channel="692087" start="20250908171200 +0000" stop="20250908190400 +0000"><title>Torn</title><desc>After discovering his wife is cheating on him, Delroy has to decide whether to pursue a promising new relationship, or fix his troubled marriage.</desc></programme><programme channel="692087" start="20250908190400 +0000" stop="20250908211300 +0000"><title>Love &amp; Drugs 2: The Sacrifice</title><desc>A man who believed his life was going in the right direction is faced with a decision to either betray the woman he loves or turn on his best friend.</desc></programme><programme channel="692087" start="20250908211300 +0000" stop="20250908232000 +0000"><title>Imprisoned by Love</title><desc>Below the surface of her perfect life, Tracie weathers constant marital abuse for the sake of her children.

As a result, Yami Marik becomes angered, and attacks Odion with the Millennium Rod, which weakens Odion even more. Odion doesn't give up, despite Ishizu's protests. As Marik continues his onslaught (which begins to injure Odion), Odion tells Marik's good side that together, they had conquered his evil half before, and that they could do it again. Then, he tells the good Marik that since Yami Marik was created by the good Marik's hatred, he has the power to destroy him. As Yami Marik raises the Rod to deliver the final blow, the good Marik disappears from the field, and begins fighting against Yami Marik, who struggles for control over Marik's body, and refuses to be defeated. However, Marik's good half stalls Yami Marik long enough for Yugi to activate his spell card. Yugi's Ragnarok spell succeeds in destroying (and removing to the graveyard) Ra, allowing the good Marik to regain control of his body. However, a sliver of Yami Marik reappears on the field, although this time, he is the victim. Yami Marik tries to convince the good Marik to help him seize the Millennium Items and rule the world together, but fails as Marik has decided to stop being evil and make up for his actions. Marik surrenders the duel to Yugi, which sends Yami Marik to the Shadow Realm, ending the Battle City finals. Bakura and Mai are returned from the shadow realm and Marik is reunited with his siblings, who forgive him. Yugi receives the three Egyptian God Cards. Kaiba then activates the Duel Tower's self-destruct sequence, giving everybody one hour to get off the island before it explodes.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000033" start="20250908153000 +0000" stop="20250908160000 +0000"><title>Yu-Gi-Oh!</title><desc>Yugi and the gang escape from the island in time, but they are forced to leave Kaiba and Mokuba behind.

The detectives soon learn that a feud is raging between local occult practitioner Ernest Balliol and famous writer Aloysius Wilmington. While some of the villagers - such as Ernest's daughter Isolde - believe that powerful magical forces are at play, others think the reasons for the bloodshed may have their roots in the distant past. Barnaby and Jones soon find themselves delving into the occult, magic, and ancients books of power, to determine what happened, and soon sense a mixture of both might be the motive for the murder, when a book shop owner is killed with shattered glass, laced in the same poison.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20250908080000 +0000" stop="20250908100000 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>Barnaby and Jones are forced to take part in a team building exercise and Tom has plenty of problems dealing with the young, new, acting Chief Superintendent, John Cotton (Nick Fletcher).
