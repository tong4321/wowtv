Presented as a series of short vignettes recorded in an intimate, close-cropped setting to engage the viewer as if he or she is soul seeking wisdom at the foot of a sage. Weaving the journey and anecdotes of some of the most prolific high profile ministers, evangelists and church leaders of the 21st Century, The Scroll took three years to complete, interviewing over 50 of the U.S.'s most progressive and revered Spiritual Leaders.</desc></programme><programme channel="692087" start="20250929050700 +0000" stop="20250929063400 +0000"><title>Death by Envy</title><desc>An entire neighborhood is rattled after a 31-year-old man with a promising future is murdered in front of his wife during an attempted armed robbery.</desc></programme><programme channel="692087" start="20250929063400 +0000" stop="20250929081900 +0000"><title>Cleaver Family Reunion</title><desc>This year, the delightfully dysfunctional Cleaver family will settle their differences once and for all... with a few misadventures along the way.</desc></programme><programme channel="692087" start="20250929081900 +0000" stop="20250929095800 +0000"><title>My Other Mother</title><desc>Adopted as a child, an anchorwoman finds herself reconnecting with her birth mother and extended family while attending the funeral of her father.</desc></programme><programme channel="692087" start="20250929095800 +0000" stop="20250929114000 +0000"><title>Subspiral</title><desc>A young man who has worked to take a different path from his wayward brother falls for a woman who forces him into the life he’d hoped to avoid.</desc></programme><programme channel="692087" start="20250929114000 +0000" stop="20250929131300 +0000"><title>Stock Option</title><desc>When a down-on-his-luck stockbroker living on the street rescues a famous model from a robbery, sparks fly between the unlikely pair.</desc></programme><programme channel="692087" start="20250929131300 +0000" stop="20250929145800 +0000"><title>Clover</title><desc>When her father dies shortly after his remarriage, a young African American girl struggles to cope while left in the care of her new, white stepmom.</desc></programme><programme channel="692087" start="20250929145800 +0000" stop="20250929164600 +0000"><title>The 70% Club</title><desc>Close friends helping a friend get married and another get divorced are thrown off by the overwhelming statistic that 70% of black women are single.</desc></programme><programme channel="692087" start="20250929164600 +0000" stop="20250929181500 +0000"><title>Hopetown</title><desc>An ex Golden Glove champion attempts to fix his relationship with his sister.</desc></programme><programme channel="692087" start="20250929181500 +0000" stop="20250929203200 +0000"><title>Don't Shoot</title><desc>Following the shooting of an unarmed Black teen by two White officers, a city is divided in the fight to seek social justice and reform.</desc></programme><programme channel="692087" start="20250929203200 +0000" stop="20250929224100 +0000"><title>Love &amp; Drugs 2: The Sacrifice</title><desc>A man who believed his life was going in the right direction is faced with a decision to either betray the woman he loves or turn on his best friend.</desc></programme><programme channel="692087" start="20250929224100 +0000" stop="20250930003300 +0000"><title>Love Won't Let Me Wait</title><desc>A magnetic playboy with bad intentions manages to date three sisters and uses his charms to convince their unsuspecting mother that he is a good guy.</desc></programme><channel id="400000004"><display-name>Revolt Mixtape</display-name><icon src="https://canvas-lb.tubitv.com/opts/4B20EMNDD-lyNA==/42481df4-a22f-4a86-90db-db1f96840422/CHgQeDoFMS4xLjhAAQ==" /></channel><programme channel="400000004" start="20250928120000 +0000" stop="20250928130000 +0000"><title>Kingdom Culture with T.D.

The next morning, when Frances Kirby is out for her morning jog, she notices the vintage car they were in up at the airfield, containing Simon Bright's dead body, with Laura nowhere to be seen. Confused, Detective Chief Inspector Barnaby and D.S. Jones can't work out whether it was a suicide pact or murder. Furthermore, they've got to find Miss Sharp and their investigation leads them to linking Simon and Laura with the villagers of Morton Fendle, who met at Elaine Trim's dancing classes.

Things become even more complex when Rex's body is found in a nearby river, bearing wounds that suggest he was murdered. Barnaby and Jones are soon on the case, trying to establish who would have wanted the elderly man dead. Several people soon come forward with multiple wills, which confuse the matter, but when two more people, close friends of Rex, are also murdered, the investigation raises question on the motive, leading Barnaby to wonder if it was down to finances, passion, or something from Rex's past.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20250928233100 +0000" stop="20250929012100 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>Following the death of Alan King while on a business trip to China, the family company, King's Crystal, is in financial trouble.

In addition to strife between members of the family, the factory workers are outraged at the loss of their jobs.

During their opening performance, the band's singer, Mimi (Suzi Quatro), falls to the ground dead - electrocuted by a wire that had been run through the microphone stand. Barnaby and Jones soon find the rest of the band could be targets, and when another is killed, questions are raised as to whether former band member, Ginger Foxton, who went missing for 30 years and is presumed dead, is still at large.

There are certainly possible suspects in the murder and attempt on Kirkwood, from Delyth's children, who oppose the engagement, Delyth's husband, and more, as the detectives investigate things, in hopes of uncovering the truth before a major walk is to take place on Mount Snowdon.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20250929045800 +0000" stop="20250929064800 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>In the build-up to Luxton Deeping's annual photographic exhibition, a battle rages between the traditional and digital photographers of the pretty village.

Barnaby soon gets to work tracking down the killer, but it seems someone is trying to implicate the detective in the murder. And once he is replaced on the case, finding the culprit seems less likely than ever, as his replacement is more concerned of an upcoming wedding than the investigation.

There are certainly dark secrets to uncover, and Barnaby has to determine whether the victim's part in a scandal years earlier at Causton police station, is key to the mystery behind his death. It isn't long before he finds that Eddie Marston is attempting blackmail, and soon murdered as a result, and that Lord Holm is in love with Jack's wife, psychotherapist Gina.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20250929102700 +0000" stop="20250929121400 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>The ghost village of Little Auburn has been abandoned since the war.
