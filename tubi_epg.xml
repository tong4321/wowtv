The food culture in Kyushu dates back to the emperors of Japan, and the Black Current off the eastern shore has shaped the island's cuisine for centuries. The DIRT team followed that current up the coastline, surfing with new friends and tasting new flavors.

From long-held traditions to the modern-day artisanal movement, he unearthed the multicultural goldmine between the highlands and the Wild Atlantic Way—with stops for surfing, a seaweed bath, and a couple holes of golf spectated by free-range goats, of course. Foraged cocktails? Fresh crabs from Galway Bay? It’s all on the table in this episode rooted in community, homegrown ingredients, and the damn good people who bring it all together.

The DIRT crew made their way to Alaska, “the land of earth, sea, and sky.” All feast, no sleep is the name of the game as Josh makes the most of Alaska’s abundant and legendary daylight alongside local guides, fishermen, and even a couple grizzlies. There’ll be plenty of time to hibernate in winter. But for now—join us—there are halibut to filet, rainforest ’shrooms to forage, and mountainside meals to cook up.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20250919150001 +0000" stop="20250919153001 +0000"><title>Dirt</title><desc>Atlanta is a city famous for vibrant art and tasty food, so for this episode the DIRT team went looking for the real people behind the scenes working to make this city so special. Josh meets celebrated chefs, barbers, farmers, and even a butter-wrapping machine dubbed André 4000 because he's "the second best 'wrapper' in Atlanta"—though special guest Killer Mike would probably take issue with that. Thirty years ago the real André announced to the world "the South got something to say," so tune in and listen up.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20250919153001 +0000" stop="20250919160000 +0000"><title>Dirt</title><desc>"Hope you're hungry. In this episode, come along as we eat our weight in sushi and ramen, meet nori farmers and wagyu ranchers, and make some new surfing buddies along the way. P.S. if you're hungry for more Japan content, stay tuned for our next two episodes.In this episode of DIRT, the crew road tripped around Kyushu. The food culture in Kyushu dates back to the emperors of Japan, and the Black Current off the eastern shore has shaped the island's cuisine for centuries. The DIRT team followed that current up the coastline, surfing with new friends and tasting new flavors. And with each stop, we learned even more about how the traditions we keep can honor thousands of years of knowledge—and point the way to the future."</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20250919160000 +0000" stop="20250919163001 +0000"><title>Silver Kings</title><desc>Jared's long time friend and fellow guide, Greg Dini, joins Jared for a day in the backcountry.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20250919163001 +0000" stop="20250919170001 +0000"><title>Silver Kings</title><desc>Jared teams up with his long time friend Capt.
