How much is acceptable among three contestants in each episode is determined by the "dater," who hears the candidates' intimate secrets and hidden flaws, as well as their attempts to deflect these traits by describing their positive attributes. After two elimination rounds leave one remaining contestant, it's the dater's turn to reveal his or her own baggage ... and then the contestant decides to go forward with the date or not.
