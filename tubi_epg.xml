With reports of massive schools of redfish cruising the beaches, Monique (“Moe”) must decide whether to trust the intel and make a bold run down the coast—or rely on her own instincts built from years on the water. The mission is simple: put Rush on a true bull redfish and see if he has what it takes to earn a spot in her coveted “Over 40-Inch Club.” This trip highlights why Venice, Louisiana is considered one of the premier inshore fisheries in the country—and why having the right guide makes all the difference.

With reports of massive schools of redfish cruising the beaches, Monique (“Moe”) must decide whether to trust the intel and make a bold run down the coast—or rely on her own instincts built from years on the water. The mission is simple: put Rush on a true bull redfish and see if he has what it takes to earn a spot in her coveted “Over 40-Inch Club.” This trip highlights why Venice, Louisiana is considered one of the premier inshore fisheries in the country—and why having the right guide makes all the difference. Target Species: Bull Redfish. Location: Venice, Louisiana – Mississippi Delta. Outfitter: Journey South Outfitters.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20260126023010 +0000" stop="20260126030009 +0000"><title>Local Knowledge</title><desc>For Ali and Rush, one of the best aspects of fishing is being able to share experiences on the water with interesting people.
