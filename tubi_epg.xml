Various scenarios are created that force people to make split-second -- and often surprising -- decisions, and variations of the situation (such as changing the genders, races or clothing of the people involved) are often featured to see if different reactions are elicited. Examples of situations on the show include a waitress being harassed by her boss, and a drunken valet trying to park cars.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20251026050000 +0000" stop="20251026070000 +0000"><title>20/20</title><desc>Award-winning program anchored by David Muir, featuring unforgettable, character-driven true crime mysteries, exclusive newsmaker interviews, hard-hitting investigative reports and in-depth coverage of high profile stories.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20251026070000 +0000" stop="20251026073000 +0000"><title>All Access With Linsey Davis: Jeremy Allen White</title><desc>Description Unavailable</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20251026073000 +0000" stop="20251026080000 +0000"><title>Last Lands: Guatemala</title><desc>ABC News Live Special Programming.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20251026080000 +0000" stop="20251026100000 +0000"><title>20/20</title><desc>Award-winning program anchored by David Muir, featuring unforgettable, character-driven true crime mysteries, exclusive newsmaker interviews, hard-hitting investigative reports and in-depth coverage of high profile stories.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20251026100000 +0000" stop="20251026103000 +0000"><title>ABC Secret Savings</title><desc>Stay informed with the latest breaking news and headlines.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20251026103000 +0000" stop="20251026110000 +0000"><title>GMA Life</title><desc>A weekly roundup of the best lifestyle content from "Good Morning America";
