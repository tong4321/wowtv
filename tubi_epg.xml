From an extensive investigation by the Viennese police, it was determined that these murders were the work of one sadistic predator.  Europe was dealing with a serial killer.  With no experience with this kind of predator, Viennese police turned to the FBI. FBI profilers were able to identify a suspect in the murders.  More ominously, they linked this same killer to murders committed in the United States.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000091" start="20250819203300 +0000" stop="20250819213100 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>He wandered the streets of New York City wearing only pajamas and a bathrobe, but the FBI was convinced that Vince Gigante, the reputed boss of the Genovese crime family, was anything but crazy.
