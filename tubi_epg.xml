Every summer, the Amateur Trapshooting Association hosts The Grand American in Sparta, Illinois. This year marks the 125th Anniversary for the largest trap shooting competition in the world. We’ll talk with the people who make this tournament run behind the scenes and explore what makes this tournament such a special event. We’ll also look at the rich history of The Grand. On-site we’ll chat with the curator of the Trapshooting Hall of Fame and look at some of the incredible historical pieces on display in the museum. Additionally, we’ll learn about White Flyer and how the clay manufacturer has made important innovations for the shotgun sports.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20250809233024 +0000" stop="20250809235045 +0000"><title>The Journey Within</title><desc>Mark Peterson is in Ethiopia hunting Mountain Nyala.

In an environment of violence and fear it would be difficult to identify, arrest and convict those involved in the secretive and deadly world of big money drugs.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000091" start="20250810145100 +0000" stop="20250810154800 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>Corruption in the New Orleans Police Department grew like a cancer in the early 1990's.  Lured by the easy wealth of the narcotics industry, crooked cops began breaking the laws they were sworn to uphold. They would stop at nothing, including murder, to protect their rackets. When it became clear they could no longer police themselves, the FBI got involved. Putting their lives on the line, undercover agents devised a way to flush out the violent cops and restore trust in the city's police force.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000091" start="20250810154800 +0000" stop="20250810164800 +0000"><title>Los archivos del FBI (Doblado)</title><desc>El primero de octubre de 1993, un extraño secuestró a Polly Klaas de doce años durante una piyamada en su casa.
