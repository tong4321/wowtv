Teaming up with Florida Sea Grant, University of Florida, Gulf States Marine Fisheries Commission, NOAA, and a diverse coalition of partners, the project delivers training, equipment, and research funding to tackle depredation and release mortality issues. Moreover, it evaluates the efficacy of descending devices, ultimately promoting improved fish survival, a more robust fishery, and enriched angling experiences across the Gulf of Mexico.This podcast is presented by Black Rifle Coffee Use code BLASTOFF25 for 25% offSalt Strong Insiders Club: https://bit.ly/RowlandMembershipLMNT Electrolytes Special Offer: http://DrinkLMNT.com/TomRowlandIf you have questions or suggestions for the show you can text Tom at 1 305-930-7346This episode has been brought to you by Waypoint TV.
