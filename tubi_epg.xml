Second only to Alaska in size, Texas is known as the place where everything is bigger. From big college football games to endless oil fields and vast wind farms, Texas is home to more than 30 million Americans. But the state is about more than just big oil, college football and cattle farms - it's also home to some of the best boating in the country. Boasting a myriad of waterways, boaters here enjoy hundreds of lakes, rivers and streams that provide recreational opportunities, abundant wildlife and plenty of fishing. From Austin Texas to San Antonio host Ryan McVinney and the Boat Trader crew explore the laid-back Texas lake life including boat up restaurants along the Colorado River, watersports in Austin and the history of the waterways throughout the region. Boat manufacturers highlighted in this episode are Tige Boats and ATX Surf Boats, two premium Texas-based wake boat brands known for their high-quality, cutting-edge vessels that come equipped with advanced wake shaping technologies and equipment ideal for water skiing, wake surfing and wakeboarding. There's even a wake surfing dog!</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20250813023002 +0000" stop="20250813030000 +0000"><title>Dirt</title><desc>"Hope you're hungry.

P.S. if you're hungry for more Japan content, stay tuned for our next two episodes.In this episode of DIRT, the crew road tripped around Kyushu. The food culture in Kyushu dates back to the emperors of Japan, and the Black Current off the eastern shore has shaped the island's cuisine for centuries. The DIRT team followed that current up the coastline, surfing with new friends and tasting new flavors. And with each stop, we learned even more about how the traditions we keep can honor thousands of years of knowledge—and point the way to the future."</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20250813030000 +0000" stop="20250813033000 +0000"><title>Duck Camp Dinners</title><desc>The Duck Camp Dinners crew leaves the bayous and heads down river to Venice, Louisiana where they prepare for their first duck hunt in the delta.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20250813033000 +0000" stop="20250813040000 +0000"><title>Goin' Coastal</title><desc>Josh and his wife Anna celebrate the first day of summer by taking their daughters out for a fun-filled day on the water.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20250813040000 +0000" stop="20250813041602 +0000"><title>Storytellers</title><desc>Follow TTHA President/CEO Christina Pittman and her husband Matt this week as they chase Whitetails at Morrow Ranch.

Second only to Alaska in size, Texas is known as the place where everything is bigger. From big college football games to endless oil fields and vast wind farms, Texas is home to more than 30 million Americans. But the state is about more than just big oil, college football and cattle farms - it's also home to some of the best boating in the country. Boasting a myriad of waterways, boaters here enjoy hundreds of lakes, rivers and streams that provide recreational opportunities, abundant wildlife and plenty of fishing. From Austin Texas to San Antonio host Ryan McVinney and the Boat Trader crew explore the laid-back Texas lake life including boat up restaurants along the Colorado River, watersports in Austin and the history of the waterways throughout the region. Boat manufacturers highlighted in this episode are Tige Boats and ATX Surf Boats, two premium Texas-based wake boat brands known for their high-quality, cutting-edge vessels that come equipped with advanced wake shaping technologies and equipment ideal for water skiing, wake surfing and wakeboarding. There's even a wake surfing dog!</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20250813023002 +0000" stop="20250813030000 +0000"><title>Dirt</title><desc>"Hope you're hungry.

P.S. if you're hungry for more Japan content, stay tuned for our next two episodes.In this episode of DIRT, the crew road tripped around Kyushu. The food culture in Kyushu dates back to the emperors of Japan, and the Black Current off the eastern shore has shaped the island's cuisine for centuries. The DIRT team followed that current up the coastline, surfing with new friends and tasting new flavors. And with each stop, we learned even more about how the traditions we keep can honor thousands of years of knowledge—and point the way to the future."</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20250813030000 +0000" stop="20250813033000 +0000"><title>Duck Camp Dinners</title><desc>The Duck Camp Dinners crew leaves the bayous and heads down river to Venice, Louisiana where they prepare for their first duck hunt in the delta.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20250813033000 +0000" stop="20250813040000 +0000"><title>Goin' Coastal</title><desc>Josh and his wife Anna celebrate the first day of summer by taking their daughters out for a fun-filled day on the water.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20250813040000 +0000" stop="20250813041602 +0000"><title>Storytellers</title><desc>Follow TTHA President/CEO Christina Pittman and her husband Matt this week as they chase Whitetails at Morrow Ranch.

When the post mortem confirms her death was no accident, the pair discover that nothing is what it seems to be within the little village as they try to find out what exactly she saw.

When Agnes's cousin, Esslyn Carmichael, inadvertently cuts his own throat during the final act, it's quickly discovered that the tape on the prop blade he had used was removed without anyone knowing.
