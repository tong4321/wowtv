In addition to strife between members of the family, the factory workers are outraged at the loss of their jobs. So when company accountant Peter Baxter is found murdered, Barnaby and Jones suspect a disgruntled employee is to blame.

Barnaby himself is particularly looking forward to seeing recently re-formed rock band, Hired Gun, perform on stage, but he soon gets close to the band for rather unfortunate reasons. During their opening performance, the band's singer, Mimi (Suzi Quatro), falls to the ground dead - electrocuted by a wire that had been run through the microphone stand. Barnaby and Jones soon find the rest of the band could be targets, and when another is killed, questions are raised as to whether former band member, Ginger Foxton, who went missing for 30 years and is presumed dead, is still at large. The detectives soon have to delve into a world of rock music, drug use and greed, to find the truth.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20250901100000 +0000" stop="20250901110000 +0000"><title>Private Eyes</title><desc>During her recovery from an injury, Angie hears someone threatened from her hospital room while under the influence of a drug; no one believes her.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20250901110000 +0000" stop="20250901120000 +0000"><title>Private Eyes</title><desc>At Angie's high school reunion, she drags Shade along so she doesn't have to confront her ex-BFF, Jada Berry, alone; after a body ends up on the dance floor, it's up to the PE crew to solve the mysterious murder.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20250901120000 +0000" stop="20250901130000 +0000"><title>Private Eyes</title><desc>When local radio therapist, Dr. Rohan Love (Huse Madhavji), starts acting strangely and spending huge sums of money, his wife Meera hires Shade and Angie to find out what secret he's hiding.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20250901130000 +0000" stop="20250901140000 +0000"><title>Private Eyes</title><desc>Shade's precious Porsche is stolen at a luxury car show and he suspects his old hockey rival Mark "Lytnin'" Lyte (Dion Johnstone) might be to blame; Meanwhile, Angie struggles with PTSD.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20250901140000 +0000" stop="20250901150000 +0000"><title>Private Eyes</title><desc>When a young writer close to fame and fortune is threatened and then a famous guest drops dead, Shade, Angie and Tex find themselves following a trail of clues that lead them into a world of jealousy, desperation and greed.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20250901150000 +0000" stop="20250901160000 +0000"><title>Private Eyes</title><desc>While visiting Nora and her serious boo, Rory, Shade and Angie learn that a pair of Billy the Kid's cowboy boots have gone missing from the local museum; when Rory gets fingered as the prime suspect, Angie and Shade race to find Billy's secret.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20250901160000 +0000" stop="20250901170000 +0000"><title>Hudson &amp; Rex</title><desc>When a murder appears to mimic an infamous crime spree from the past, Charlie and Rex rush to stop the culprit from continuing a serial killer's legacy.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20250901170000 +0000" stop="20250901180000 +0000"><title>Hudson &amp; Rex</title><desc>Charlie lets Rex take the lead as they investigate a murder at a prestigious dog show.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20250901180000 +0000" stop="20250901190000 +0000"><title>Hudson &amp; Rex</title><desc>Trapped in an isolated mansion during a storm, Charlie and Rex uncover a wannabe-killer after the hostess is drugged; Sarah fights to keep her alive.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20250901190000 +0000" stop="20250901200000 +0000"><title>Hudson &amp; Rex</title><desc>Jesse's friend vanishes; Charlie and Rex discover the man was living two separate lives.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20250901200000 +0000" stop="20250901210000 +0000"><title>Hudson &amp; Rex</title><desc>A magician dies during a practice-run of her latest routine; Charlie and Rex must look beyond the smoke and mirrors to uncover the truth.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20250901210000 +0000" stop="20250901220000 +0000"><title>Hudson &amp; Rex</title><desc>Charlie and Rex witness an armed robbery during a trip to the bank; they discover a connection to a string of ingenious unsolved heists.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20250901220000 +0000" stop="20250901230000 +0000"><title>Hudson &amp; Rex</title><desc>When two hikers are discovered murdered near a remote coastal trail, the team is on the hunt for a fugitive duo wanted in a series of grisly campsite murders.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20250901230000 +0000" stop="20250902000000 +0000"><title>Hudson &amp; Rex</title><desc>The team uncovers the distorted loyalties that forms when personal ties meet the trappings of fame, when a troubled pop star is suspected of killing her fiancé.</desc></programme><channel id="715943"><display-name>Watchlist</display-name><icon src="https://canvas-lb.tubitv.com/opts/zi--5VQF6X4ojQ==/3f255caf-ac21-456a-add4-31745babe3cb/CHgQeDoFMS4xLjhAAQ==" /></channel><programme channel="715943" start="20250831123922 +0000" stop="20250831132954 +0000"><title>La Femme Nikita</title><desc>Operations and Madeline put into play another plan to separate Michael and Nikita.</desc></programme><programme channel="715943" start="20250831132954 +0000" stop="20250831141637 +0000"><title>Nikita</title><desc>Amanda interrogates Alex.
