To make matters worse the credit crunch has hit and there is fierce competition from corporate chains.

With the advent of the credit crunch, soaring food prices, thrifty clientele and unrelenting competition from the high street chains, Gordon is determined to galvanise the owners, the staff and the local community to ensure their survival and keep customers coming back for more.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250623222400 +0000" stop="20250623232300 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers: Extreme</title><desc>Two new artists join Sketch, Alice and Paisley to tackle extreme tattoos; Pash gets rid of Ollie's naughty naval tatt, while Uzzi wipes away Brandon's cleaning slip-up; Sketch covers grandad Mick's bold brag; Uzzi tattoos a memorial.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250623232300 +0000" stop="20250624002300 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers: Extreme</title><desc>Alice covers Hannah's shocking memorial to her wild-child years; Uzzi takes on Alan's tribute to an R'n'B star; Sketch rids Kaylee of an obscene arm tattoo; Alice creates a design to celebrate Jane's best friend.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250624002300 +0000" stop="20250624012000 +0000"><title>Plastic Surgery Knifemares</title><desc>Sue's 'cut price' tummy tuck in Turkey almost killed her and Oli's quest to become a Korean pop star led him to spend £100,000 to look like his Asian idols.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250624012000 +0000" stop="20250624021700 +0000"><title>Plastic Surgery Knifemares</title><desc>A firsthand account of so-called 'Botox Parties'.

Flying doctor Jez is confronted by a baffling whodunnit after a man is accidentally shot at a firing range. A jockey thrown by his galloping horse amazes the team with his toughness as he undergoes treatment on a broken bone without even flinching. Meanwhile, a crash outside one of Yorkshire’s most famous stately homes leaves a man with a chronic medical condition trapped in his upturned car.

The menu is past its sell-by date, the service is stuffy, the food is over-priced and the only thing being fed is his ego. Yet, despite debts of ~£100k and the prospect of putting his home at risk and his young family on the streets, Nick continues to cook comatose in a 1990s fantasy land of his own making.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250624220400 +0000" stop="20250624225600 +0000"><title>Hotel Hell</title><desc>Gordon visits West Dover in Vermont, to try to save a dog-friendly hotel that’s desperately in need of help.
