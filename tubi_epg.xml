York. City. That’s where our host Josh Rosen kicks off his journey in Episode 4—and where he lived for 16 years and started up the surf-centric apparel brand, Saturdays NYC. Back in his old stomping grounds, Josh first meets up with the award-winning chef and Mumbai native, Chintan Pandya, currently blowing up the New York food scene with his unapologetic and authentic Indian cuisine (pro tip: try the goat brains). Next, Josh travels through the boroughs, heads upstate, and along the coast to source local ingredients—from sake brewers and pig farmers to catching fresh lobster just 100 miles from Wall Street. As always the adventure will end with a feast, right back in Chintan’s kitchen.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20250711153009 +0000" stop="20250711160019 +0000"><title>Dirt</title><desc>"Hope you're hungry. In this episode, come along as we eat our weight in sushi and ramen, meet nori farmers and wagyu ranchers, and make some new surfing buddies along the way. P.S. if you're hungry for more Japan content, stay tuned for our next two episodes.In this episode of DIRT, the crew road tripped around Kyushu. The food culture in Kyushu dates back to the emperors of Japan, and the Black Current off the eastern shore has shaped the island's cuisine for centuries. The DIRT team followed that current up the coastline, surfing with new friends and tasting new flavors. And with each stop, we learned even more about how the traditions we keep can honor thousands of years of knowledge—and point the way to the future."</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20250711160019 +0000" stop="20250711163005 +0000"><title>Silver KIngs</title><desc>14 year old Fly Angler Stevie Kim-Rubell joins Jared in Islamorada.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20250711163005 +0000" stop="20250711170012 +0000"><title>Silver Kings</title><desc>Capt.
