Just as Barnaby begins to learn that Ruth was not all she seemed to be, officers of the NIS pull him off the case. While Troy is allowed to assist them, Barnaby is left handling a local operation into a spate of thefts, yet he decides to continue his investigations in secret. In doing so, he soon turns up armed robbery, unaccounted stolen money, former criminals, and secret liaisons, before discovering that the NIS investigation is not being as thorough as it should be.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20251210081500 +0000" stop="20251210101200 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>At his family home in Upper Warden, arrogant actor Larry Smith is killed, when a summer house he walks in to as part of a promotion for the sequel to his hit film, The House of Satan, is suddenly destroyed in an explosion. His family quickly fling accusations for his murder directly at the residents of rival village, Lower Warden, leading Barnaby and Troy to determine if this is the case, especially when Larry's director, another member of the family, is electrocuted while using an exercise bike. It's not long before secrets, affairs and blackmail begin to surface from within the two villages.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20251210101200 +0000" stop="20251210120900 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>While Troy assists an attractive wildlife liaison officer with an investigation into the illegal sale of protected bird eggs, Barnaby travels to Midsomer Magna to investigate the sudden death of a man, who apparently drowned himself. While there was evidence he was desperately seeking to avoid bankruptcy, and had visited a local millionaire to get back his money from a scheme he had invested in, a post mortem reveals that he had been murdered. The two detectives soon find their investigations crossing over, when a man found to have an illegal collection of bird eggs, is also murdered, prompting concerns that the millionaire's scheme is being used to defraud many, and that someone is willing to kill to keep the scheme going.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20251210120900 +0000" stop="20251210135700 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>Causton is buzzing at the opening of a new brewery on the site of a famously cursed Abbey.
