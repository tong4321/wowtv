Volunteers were divided into teams and sent to six different sites along the river to collect insect nymphs and larvae—tiny but mighty indicators of water health.Over 223 specimens were gathered, from stoneflies and mayflies to dragonfly larvae. These macroinvertebrates are highly sensitive to their environment, and their presence (or absence) can tell us a lot about the state of the river.The results? Based on initial identifications, the Cedar River shows signs of excellent water quality—making it one of Michigan’s prized Blue Ribbon Trout Streams.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20250815025959 +0000" stop="20250815033001 +0000"><title>Modern Hunter</title><desc>Veteran Army Pilot, Stephanie Garcia, hunts for an axis buck as part of the Bucks for the Brave program.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20250815033001 +0000" stop="20250815040013 +0000"><title>Louisiana Catch and Cook</title><desc>We're BACK in Lafitte continuing our adventure in Jefferson Parish.

Volunteers were divided into teams and sent to six different sites along the river to collect insect nymphs and larvae—tiny but mighty indicators of water health.Over 223 specimens were gathered, from stoneflies and mayflies to dragonfly larvae. These macroinvertebrates are highly sensitive to their environment, and their presence (or absence) can tell us a lot about the state of the river.The results? Based on initial identifications, the Cedar River shows signs of excellent water quality—making it one of Michigan’s prized Blue Ribbon Trout Streams.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20250815025959 +0000" stop="20250815033001 +0000"><title>Modern Hunter</title><desc>Veteran Army Pilot, Stephanie Garcia, hunts for an axis buck as part of the Bucks for the Brave program.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20250815033001 +0000" stop="20250815040013 +0000"><title>Louisiana Catch and Cook</title><desc>We're BACK in Lafitte continuing our adventure in Jefferson Parish.
