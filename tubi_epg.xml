Various scenarios are created that force people to make split-second -- and often surprising -- decisions, and variations of the situation (such as changing the genders, races or clothing of the people involved) are often featured to see if different reactions are elicited. Examples of situations on the show include a waitress being harassed by her boss, and a drunken valet trying to park cars.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20250907080000 +0000"

With their honeymoon cancelled, the Fitzroys must contend with a police presence in their home, as Barnaby and Jones try to learn more about the family history.

Tommy's son Lionel and grandson Dave, mayor of Causton and whom Barnaby does not like (owing to dodgy building work by the mayor's company), are thrilled, but the snooty Hammonds are decidedly less pleased. Henry, the patriarch of the Hammond family, is particularly riled by his insalubrious neighbours, and has nurtured a long-running feud with the Hickses. But the evening after a battle re-enactment in the village, Henry is murdered - and Barnaby must delve into the history of the two families to find the killer, discovering a web of fraud, lies, and hidden truths.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20250907140600 +0000" stop="20250907155700 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>Barnaby and Jones are in Dunstan to investigate the deaths of a reclusive couple.

When another death occurs, the detectives learn that there are plenty of dark secrets and fierce hostilities in this apparently idyllic village. Will Jack Purdy's quick temper lead to violence? How far would the protesters go to prevent the bypass being built?

Austria. From an extensive investigation by the Viennese police, it was determined that these murders were the work of one sadistic predator.  Europe was dealing with a serial killer.  With no experience with this kind of predator, Viennese police turned to the FBI. FBI profilers were able to identify a suspect in the murders.  More ominously, they linked this same killer to murders committed in the United States.</desc></programme><programme channel="682630" start="20250907110000 +0000" stop="20250907120000 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>A 1981 armored car robbery near New York City left one guard dead and another critically wounded.
