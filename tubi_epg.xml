Various scenarios are created that force people to make split-second -- and often surprising -- decisions, and variations of the situation (such as changing the genders, races or clothing of the people involved) are often featured to see if different reactions are elicited. Examples of situations on the show include a waitress being harassed by her boss, and a drunken valet trying to park cars.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20260104090000 +0000" stop="20260104110000 +0000"><title>20/20</title><desc>Award-winning program anchored by David Muir, featuring unforgettable, character-driven true crime mysteries, exclusive newsmaker interviews, hard-hitting investigative reports and in-depth coverage of high profile stories.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20260104110000 +0000" stop="20260104113000 +0000"><title>Daddy Yankee to DY: A Higher Note</title><desc>ABC New Live Special Programming.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20260104113000 +0000" stop="20260104120000 +0000"><title>GMA Life</title><desc>A weekly roundup of the best lifestyle content from "Good Morning America";

Do?</title><desc>Using hidden cameras, host John Quiñones observes and comments on how ordinary people behave when they are confronted with dilemmas that require them either to take action or to walk by and mind their own business. Various scenarios are created that force people to make split-second -- and often surprising -- decisions, and variations of the situation (such as changing the genders, races or clothing of the people involved) are often featured to see if different reactions are elicited. Examples of situations on the show include a waitress being harassed by her boss, and a drunken valet trying to park cars.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20260104090000 +0000" stop="20260104110000 +0000"><title>20/20</title><desc>Award-winning program anchored by David Muir, featuring unforgettable, character-driven true crime mysteries, exclusive newsmaker interviews, hard-hitting investigative reports and in-depth coverage of high profile stories.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20260104110000 +0000" stop="20260104113000 +0000"><title>Daddy Yankee to DY: A Higher Note</title><desc>ABC New Live Special Programming.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20260104113000 +0000" stop="20260104120000 +0000"><title>GMA Life</title><desc>A weekly roundup of the best lifestyle content from "Good Morning America";

Owner CHARITA JONES was producing a menu of irresistible unique classics from the Deep South, but at the same facing financial disaster. The punters were missing, and so was her business acumen. But Gordon succeeded in shutting her out of the kitchen, getting the chef back on the boil and putting the soul back into the business.

Today Charita is fully-booked round the clock and bursting out of the Soul Shack to take on the 110-seater Momma Cherri's Big House. But expansion brings a different set of challenges, and she's still struggling to control her staff and manage her success. Has she got what it takes to make the next step up, or will she be forced to rethink her grand plans?</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20260104060000 +0000" stop="20260104070000 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>In tonight's penultimate programme Gordon returns to La Riviera - now renamed Abstract - a fine dining restaurant in Inverness. Owned by multi-millionaire Barry Larson and costing ~£8000 a week to run, the place boasted top French chef Loic Lefebvre and an impeccably-trained kitchen staff, all of them on a mission to bring sophisticated French cooking to the home of the haggis. But the locals weren't biting and the restaurant was empty most nights. Gordon's recipe for survival forced them to tone down their act and demystify the menu to get the punters in. Today the restaurant's return to form has led to plans for expansion. Loic is still there, and now he's been promoted to Executive Chef he will oversee any new ventures. But can he continue to resist a return to French frills, and has he managed to pull off his own personal ambition, a Michelin star?</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20260104070000 +0000" stop="20260104080000 +0000"><title>The F Word</title><desc>S04:E04 - Episode 4</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20260104080000 +0000" stop="20260104090000 +0000"><title>The F Word</title><desc>S04:E05 - Episode 5</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20260104090000 +0000" stop="20260104100000 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Best Restaurant</title><desc>S01:E08 - Spanish</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20260104100000 +0000" stop="20260104110000 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Best Restaurant</title><desc>S01:E09 - Semi Final 1</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20260104110000 +0000" stop="20260104120000 +0000"><title>The F Word</title><desc>S03:E07 - The F Word</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20260104120000 +0000" stop="20260104130000 +0000"><title>The F Word</title><desc>S03:E08 - The F Word</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20260104130000 +0000" stop="20260104140000 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>Tonight, for the first time ever on Kitchen Nightmares, Gordon takes on a nightmare restaurant abroad.

La Parra de Burriana is an ex-pat restaurant in Nerja on Spain's Costa del Sol. Nestling among the cafes lining the seafront offering all-day English breakfast and chips, La Parra is the brainchild of twenty-six-year-old ex-nightclub manager Laurence. He set himself up in business eighteen months ago with a loan from his dad and, although he's not an experienced chef, mans the kitchen on his own, determined to offer something better than chips to his largely British clientele.</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20260105060000 +0000" stop="20260105070000 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>In tonight's second programme Gordon tackles a pub for the first time, getting to grips with The Fenwick Arms in rural Lancashire.
