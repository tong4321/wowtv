Tim Gray was the 21 year-old Head Chef at Bonaparte's in Silsden, West Yorkshire. Claiming to specialise in "fine dining", he had ambitions to be a TV chef and dreamed of opening restaurants in London, Paris and New York. Unfortunately, Tim couldn't even cook an omelette and his trademark scallops made Ramsay throw up. A true kitchen nightmare if ever there was one.

With no customers and a fridge full of fancy ingredients, Bonaparte's was losing money fast. Ramsay soon established that what the people of Silsden really want to eat is Beef and Ale Pie and Treacle Tart. Ramsay soon had the restaurant chocker block but what state is it in now?</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20251122180000 +0000" stop="20251122190000 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>Saturday night at The Glass House Restaurant in Ambleside was a disaster.  Orders in the kitchen were mixed up, the food wasn't cooked properly and the customers were complaining.  Not only was the chef in tears, but the owners were on the brink of bankruptcy.   

A few months on, there have been some departures from the Glass House. Who is in charge of the kitchen now? And, more importantly, is Ramsay's Caesar salad still on the menu?</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20251122190000 +0000" stop="20251122200000 +0000"><title>The F

The project supports sturgeon population recovery through egg collection, hatchery programs, and community events like Port Huron’s Sturgeon Fest, organized by the Friends of the St. Clair River. Every year since its inception in 2012, Sturgeon Fest has released young sturgeon back into the wild, contributing to the unique species' resurgence in the Great Lakes region.

But when Sonia Woodley is stabbed in the churchyard two years after the death of her abusive husband Gerald, Barnaby and Jones investigate, trying to work out who killed her. It soon becomes clear someone took a pair of tailor scissors to do the deed, but who amongst the villagers could have done so, is unclear, and the investigation is complicated, when the pair learn the local Anglican priest, the parish vicar, had received a letter from Sonia. When he himself is killed, the pair believe something in the letter may be key to solving the mystery.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20251121190000 +0000" stop="20251121204700 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>Barnaby is not convinced about Mayor David Hicks' plans to revive an annual trip to Brighton, suspecting his proposal to buy coastal land there, is rather a fraudulent scheme.
