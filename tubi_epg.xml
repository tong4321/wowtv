Having hunted Kentucky for over a decade and established my own properties—Bootleggers Ridge and Stonewall Plantation—I was eager for the chance at such a remarkable deer. Despite having drawn a coveted caribou tag through Worldwide Trophy Adventures’ TAGS Program, the allure of FREAK SHOW was too strong to resist. After careful planning and waiting for the right wind, I finally set out on September 11. With my crossbow in hand, I waited anxiously in the stand, my heart racing as the shadows lengthened. Just when I thought the evening might end without a sighting, a movement caught my eye, sending my pulse soaring. With caution, FREAK SHOW appeared.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20251005000025 +0000" stop="20251005003011 +0000"><title>Hunting Land Man</title><desc>Opening day in Mississippi has arrived and Slade is taking full advantage of it!

After careful planning and waiting for the right wind, I finally set out on September 11. With my crossbow in hand, I waited anxiously in the stand, my heart racing as the shadows lengthened.

When the post mortem confirms her death was no accident, the pair discover that nothing is what it seems to be within the little village as they try to find out what exactly she saw. Their investigation introduces Barnaby and Troy to many eccentric and quirky residents and soon turns up a web of sex, blackmail and lies, and the possibility that the murder could be connected to a shooting accident two years ago, which claimed another woman's life.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20251005175500 +0000" stop="20251005194300 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>When a pub landlady is crushed to death during a magic show in Midsomer Oaks, Barnaby and Nelson uncover conflict between the village church and ancient pagan traditions.
