Things soon come to a head when independent environmental supervisor, Frank Hopkirk, is found stabbed to death at a Jubb's Timber Yard, the site of the new supermarket, by a pair of children. When Barnaby and Jones investigate to determine who wanted Hopkirk dead, they find out that he secretly came to the village under various aliases for sexual rendezvous with various women in fantasy role-playing scenarios, and that he had been making further investigations on the future development site and having doubts over claims it was contaminated. Either someone didn't like his investigations, or someone didn't like his sexual appetite, but either way, Barnaby finds himself investigating lies and more to uncover the truth.</desc></programme><programme channel="684167" start="20250708140000 +0000" stop="20250708150000 +0000"><title>CSI: Miami</title><desc>While investigating a murder in a boutique, Horatio learns that Julia's (Elizabeth Berkley) instability has made her a danger to others.</desc></programme><programme channel="684167" start="20250708150000 +0000" stop="20250708160000 +0000"><title>CSI: Miami</title><desc>A crane crashes into a Miami high rise, putting Delko and Calleigh in danger, and ruining Horatio's best hope of catching a notorious crime boss.</desc></programme><programme channel="684167" start="20250708160000 +0000" stop="20250708170000 +0000"><title>CSI: Miami</title><desc>A man is found stabbed and handcuffed in a hotel room; a prank at the lab threatens an investigation and causes a rift in the team.</desc></programme><programme channel="684167" start="20250708170000 +0000" stop="20250708180000 +0000"><title>CSI: Miami</title><desc>The team races the clock to find a baby kidnapped by a killer, to prevent the child from becoming the next victim.</desc></programme><programme channel="684167" start="20250708180000 +0000" stop="20250708190000 +0000"><title>CSI: Miami</title><desc>Horatio steps in to prevent a police officer from getting too close to the case when a savage killer runs rampant in Miami.</desc></programme><programme channel="684167" start="20250708190000 +0000" stop="20250708200000 +0000"><title>CSI: Miami</title><desc>Horatio looks into Delko's past when a shooter targets the motel where Delko is staying.</desc></programme><programme channel="684167" start="20250708200000 +0000" stop="20250708210000 +0000"><title>CSI: Miami</title><desc>The CSI team, with the help of local tipsters, fights to save a neighborhood on the brink of being taken over by a violent street gang.</desc></programme><programme channel="684167" start="20250708210000 +0000" stop="20250708220000 +0000"><title>CSI: Miami</title><desc>The CSI team uses radical technology to unlock the secrets of a man's mind when he shows up covered in blood with no memory of where he has been.</desc></programme><programme channel="684167" start="20250708220000 +0000" stop="20250708230000 +0000"><title>CSI: Miami</title><desc>When a murder occurs during a horse race, Horatio discovers that Ryan has a personal connection to the case.</desc></programme><programme channel="684167" start="20250708230000 +0000" stop="20250709000000 +0000"><title>CSI: Miami</title><desc>Alexx Wood comes back when a murderer puts Ryan's and Calleigh's lives at risk.</desc></programme><channel id="700415"><display-name>Midsomer Murders</display-name><icon src="https://canvas-lb.tubitv.com/opts/oiGkMUJHBMVcLA==/34fa2e5d-6c68-4012-8c19-cc4afe6ad726/CHgQeDoFMS4xLjdAAQ==" /></channel><programme channel="700415" start="20250707160600 +0000" stop="20250707175200 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>The annual Midsomer Scarecrow Festival takes a grisly turn as bodies begin appearing on poles displayed alongside their straw creations; the investigation reveals rivalries that run deep and shows people will do just about anything to win.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20250707175200 +0000" stop="20250707193600 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>The Midsomer Mummers, an amateur operatic society, rehearses for its charity concert when the body of an unknown man is found in the theatre; the investigation quickly becomes a race to discover who is desperate to take centre stage.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20250707193600 +0000" stop="20250707212100 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>Each year, the village of Angel's Rise hosts the Psychic Fayre.
