It seems the club has a rift between the snobbish members, and local villagers, the latter only allowed onto the course for a few hours a week. Before long, another member turns up dead, and the detectives soon find the club has a hidden history, involving gambling, illegal money lending and assault, prompting the pair to determine if a club member, or one of its staff, is responsible for the deeds.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20250710160900 +0000" stop="20250710175700 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>A newly discovered masterpiece by landscape artist Henry Hogson causes a stir when it is auctioned for  £400,000 - just hours before its former owner is tortured and killed.
