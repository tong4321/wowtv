This year, the Rivers are Life team helped tag two juvenile sturgeons, which made their debut in the popular festival's touch tank before release.</desc></programme><channel id="400000065"><display-name>Top Gear</display-name><icon src="https://canvas-lb.tubitv.com/opts/g_SN11NtWr_adw==/45d06aa3-8a80-4864-a7b0-25a606d26be3/CHgQeDoFMS4xLjhAAQ==" /></channel><programme channel="400000065" start="20251120072538 +0000" stop="20251120083328 +0000"><title>Top Gear UK</title><desc>Jeremy, Richard and James attempt to save the planet by building their own electric car.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000065" start="20251120083328 +0000" stop="20251120094354 +0000"><title>Top Gear UK</title><desc>Jeremy and Richard settle the thorny issue of which company has made the greatest number of cars.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000065" start="20251120094354 +0000" stop="20251120105109 +0000"><title>Top Gear UK</title><desc>Richard investigates ways to speed up your next summer holiday and James tests the new Vauxhall Insignia VXR.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000065" start="20251120105109 +0000" stop="20251120115801 +0000"><title>Top Gear UK</title><desc>The boys attempt to prove that cars can be art by taking over an entire art gallery in Middlesbrough.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000065" start="20251120115801 +0000" stop="20251120132424 +0000"><title>Top Gear UK</title><desc>Clarkson, Hammond and May are dropped deep in the Bolivian rainforest armed only with three shabby 4x4s.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000065" start="20251120132424 +0000" stop="20251120143300 +0000"><title>Top Gear UK</title><desc>Jeremy makes a film about the BMW X6 and James drives the new Vauxhall Insignia VXR.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000065" start="20251120143300 +0000" stop="20251120154312 +0000"><title>Top Gear UK</title><desc>James May attempts to drive the Toyota Hilux up an active volcano in Iceland.

Her time in court has come, but DCI Barnaby is certain she still is holding things back in regards to the murder, and decides to monitor the trial. Yet a chance remark by Frances' youngest daughter, and a meeting with an old friend and psychiatrist, makes him begin to doubt the evidence for her conviction. Soon he and DC Jones, awaiting news of his promotion to DS, find themselves reinvestigating the case, and it soon becomes clear that they may have missed details that could implicate another in the murder.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20251120090000 +0000" stop="20251120110000 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>In the village of Broughton, a ninety-year-old battle of the sexes has often occurred, with men trying to oppose an event that the women have managed to successfully hold without interruption, until it culminates with casualties on both sides - Mildred Danvers, an elderly woman who had returned on the day of a funeral and poisoned in her hotel room, and Rev. Anthony Gant, shot during a major event being held in the village green, in view of many. It soon becomes clear someone may have wished to kill both to cover up a dark truth, and soon Barnaby has to figure out who amongst the village wanted both dead, complicated further when Gant's curate is murdered next.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20251120110000 +0000" stop="20251120130000 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>A disused airfield near Morton Fendle is the location for a romantic evening between young Simon Bright and his girlfriend Laura Sharp - absolutely nothing could ruin their date. The next morning, when Frances Kirby is out for her morning jog, she notices the vintage car they were in up at the airfield, containing Simon Bright's dead body, with Laura nowhere to be seen. Confused, Detective Chief Inspector Barnaby and D.S. Jones can't work out whether it was a suicide pact or murder. Furthermore, they've got to find Miss Sharp and their investigation leads them to linking Simon and Laura with the villagers of Morton Fendle, who met at Elaine Trim's dancing classes. Eventually, the Barnaby family plus Jones make it to a 40s style dance night at the village hall before more villagers start turning up dead.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20251120130000 +0000" stop="20251120150000 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>When Faith Alexander arrives in Midsomer County to meet her long-lost uncle Rex Masters, she gets a shock - Rex's staff had been told that she was dead. Things become even more complex when Rex's body is found in a nearby river, bearing wounds that suggest he was murdered. Barnaby and Jones are soon on the case, trying to establish who would have wanted the elderly man dead. Several people soon come forward with multiple wills, which confuse the matter, but when two more people, close friends of Rex, are also murdered, the investigation raises question on the motive, leading Barnaby to wonder if it was down to finances, passion, or something from Rex's past.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20251120150000 +0000" stop="20251120170000 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>Following the death of Alan King while on a business trip to China, the family company, King's Crystal, is in financial trouble.

In addition to strife between members of the family, the factory workers are outraged at the loss of their jobs. So when company accountant Peter Baxter is found murdered, Barnaby and Jones suspect a disgruntled employee is to blame. But in order to investigate the matter further, Jones is forced to work undercover, and infiltrate the local group of Freemasons in the village.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20251120170000 +0000" stop="20251120190000 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>The music lovers of Midsomer County are delighted when a host of bands arrives for the Midsomer Rocks festival. Barnaby himself is particularly looking forward to seeing recently re-formed rock band, Hired Gun, perform on stage, but he soon gets close to the band for rather unfortunate reasons. During their opening performance, the band's singer, Mimi (Suzi Quatro), falls to the ground dead - electrocuted by a wire that had been run through the microphone stand. Barnaby and Jones soon find the rest of the band could be targets, and when another is killed, questions are raised as to whether former band member, Ginger Foxton, who went missing for 30 years and is presumed dead, is still at large. The detectives soon have to delve into a world of rock music, drug use and greed, to find the truth.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20251120190000 +0000" stop="20251120200000 +0000"><title>Leverage: Redemption</title><desc>When a woman believes she is being haunted, Sophie leads Breanna and Parker through a con to convince the two real estate scammers responsible to target Leverage HQ.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20251120200000 +0000" stop="20251120210000 +0000"><title>Leverage: Redemption</title><desc>The Leverage team dives into the world of a fantasy collectible card game with a devoted following to take down a pharmaceutical bad boy who is price-gouging drugs.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20251120210000 +0000" stop="20251120220000 +0000"><title>Leverage: Redemption</title><desc>The team takes on a brilliant software developer who is selling a facial recognition system that threatens everyone's privacy except his own.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20251120220000 +0000" stop="20251120230000 +0000"><title>Leverage: Redemption</title><desc>Sophie must keep her feelings in check when she discovers that someone has written a memoir of the team, casting himself as Nate.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20251120230000 +0000" stop="20251121000000 +0000"><title>Leverage: Redemption</title><desc>The Leverage team's Holiday good deed goes awry when their attempt to give a small-town librarian the spy-thriller adventure of a lifetime is interrupted by a shadowy spy organization.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20251121000000 +0000" stop="20251121010000 +0000"><title>Leverage: Redemption</title><desc>The team tries to expose a wellness guru who is selling fake medicines to vulnerable people.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20251121010000 +0000" stop="20251121020000 +0000"><title>Leverage: Redemption</title><desc>The team picks the brain of a legendary grifter and tries to find the loot from her best con before her abusive guardian does.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20251121020000 +0000" stop="20251121030000 +0000"><title>Leverage: Redemption</title><desc>An old friend visits, sparking a self-doubting Harry to uncover an unlikely client on the links at his exclusive golf club.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20251121030000 +0000" stop="20251121040000 +0000"><title>Leverage: Redemption</title><desc>Stuck together during a massive hurricane, Eliot and Parker must stop a band of corrupt cops who have taken over a small hotel, and find what the cops are searching for.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20251121040000 +0000" stop="20251121050000 +0000"><title>Leverage: Redemption</title><desc>When a hate group targets two farmers, the team digs deep into a corrupt green energy innovator and plans a traditional train heist.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20251121050000 +0000" stop="20251121060000 +0000"><title>Sue Thomas: F.B.Eye</title><desc>When Sue's snitch Howie witnesses a murder, Sue and Jack go undercover to investigate a possible mob connection.
