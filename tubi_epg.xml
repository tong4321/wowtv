The homicide rate in the nation's capital climbed to the highest in the country.  Local police turned to the FBI for help, but agents soon found themselves in the direct line of fire.  In the fall of 1994, a gang member walked into police headquarters, killed two FBI agents and one detective, then turned the gun on himself.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000091" start="20251008185800 +0000" stop="20251008195600 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>A 1981 armored car robbery near New York City left one guard dead and another critically wounded.
