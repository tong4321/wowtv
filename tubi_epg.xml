that require them either to take action or to walk by and mind their own business. Various scenarios are created that force people to make split-second -- and often surprising -- decisions, and variations of the situation (such as changing the genders, races or clothing of the people involved) are often featured to see if different reactions are elicited. Examples of situations on the show include a waitress being harassed by her boss, and a drunken valet trying to park cars.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20260214200000 +0000" stop="20260214210000 +0000"><title>The Turpins: A New House of Horror -- A Diane Sawyer Special Event</title><desc>Three of the youngest Turpin siblings tell their stories of the past and how they experienced abuse a second time in the foster care system.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20260214210000 +0000" stop="20260214213000 +0000"><title>ABC News Live Weekend: Saturday</title><desc>Breaking news coverage and live video.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20260214213000 +0000" stop="20260214220000 +0000"><title>All Access With Linsey Davis</title><desc>A 30-minute interview franchise of ABC News Live "Prime With Linsey Davis" featuring candid conversations with celebrities, musicians, and newsmakers from across the cultural landscape.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20260214220000 +0000" stop="20260214223000 +0000"><title>ABC News Live Weekend: Saturday</title><desc>Breaking news coverage and live video.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20260214223000 +0000" stop="20260214230000 +0000"><title>ABC News Live Weekend</title><desc>Breaking news coverage and live video.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20260214230000 +0000" stop="20260215010000 +0000"><title>20/20</title><desc>Award-winning program anchored by David Muir, featuring unforgettable, character-driven true crime mysteries, exclusive newsmaker interviews, hard-hitting investigative reports and in-depth coverage of high profile stories.</desc></programme><channel id="556174"><display-name>NBC News NOW</display-name><icon src="https://canvas-lb.tubitv.com/opts/SAA3cS-V06_Q3w==/dd770066-df10-4187-b8d5-c31d0b9c0a1f/CHgQeDoFMS4xLjhAAQ==" /></channel><programme channel="556174" start="20260213020000 +0000" stop="20260213030000 +0000"><title>Top Story With Tom Llamas</title><desc>Reporting of breaking news and developing stories in real time.</desc></programme><programme channel="556174" start="20260213030000 +0000" stop="20260213040000 +0000"><title>Hallie Jackson NOW</title><desc>Reporting breaking news and developing stories in real time; covering the most important stories of the day and taking deep dives on issues.</desc></programme><programme channel="556174" start="20260213040000 +0000" stop="20260213050000 +0000"><title>Stay Tuned NOW With Gadi Schwartz</title><desc>A fresh look at the day's news, from the latest breaking news to what's on the horizon.</desc></programme><programme channel="556174" start="20260213050000 +0000" stop="20260213060000 +0000"><title>Top Story With Tom Llamas</title><desc>Reporting of breaking news and developing stories in real time.</desc></programme><programme channel="556174" start="20260213060000 +0000" stop="20260213070000 +0000"><title>Meet the Press NOW</title><desc>Looking at the key stories of the day with political newsmakers.</desc></programme><programme channel="556174" start="20260213070000 +0000" stop="20260213080000 +0000"><title>Dateline NBC</title><desc>Robert Davis, who was convicted of murdering a woman and her son, claims his confession was coerced and tries to prove he is innocent.</desc></programme><programme channel="556174" start="20260213080000 +0000" stop="20260213090000 +0000"><title>Dateline NBC</title><desc>When a former hockey player discovers his wife murdered in their home, his daughter says she saw a burglar.</desc></programme><programme channel="556174" start="20260213090000 +0000" stop="20260213100000 +0000"><title>Dateline NBC</title><desc>Detectives look into a couple's complicated past when a man finds his wife stabbed to death in their home.</desc></programme><programme channel="556174" start="20260213100000 +0000" stop="20260213103000 +0000"><title>Early Today</title><desc>This early-morning news shows, that precedes local newscasts in many markets, covers overnight events, breaking domestic and international news as well as a preview of the day's anticipated events.

It’s all in the name really, an innocent set of stairs, covered in Wipeout Crash cream. Its up the way and down the way for all and sundry. The lucky 12 that move through, battle it out with a giant toothbrush Sweeper. ‘Nat with the Tats’ and Renee ‘Lets get physical’ move through to the Dreadmill, flying the banner for the ladies. Look out for Scotty Six Toes at the Big Balls and get the ear plugs ready as you meet Herr Chris. It’s a colourful week with leotards, laughs and lots of ladies.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20260213081000 +0000" stop="20260213090601 +0000"><title>Wipeout Canada</title><desc>Dirty Balls, The Donut Swing, The Toothbrush Bristles, Tippy Tables and Dock Maze are among some of the over-the-top obstacles included in this week’s episode.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20260213090601 +0000" stop="20260213102104 +0000"><title>101 Ways to Leave a Gameshow</title><desc>More unsuspecting contestants, all competing for a 10k pound prize, are dropped, fired and dragged screaming.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20260213102104 +0000" stop="20260213113619 +0000"><title>Total Wipeout</title><desc>This is the second 'Celebrity Special' of the season.
