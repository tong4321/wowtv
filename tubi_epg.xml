Devoid of clams—which naturally filter the water—the lagoon’s water quality rapidly deteriorated as algae blooms went unchecked and sunlight could no longer reach the seagrass that is so vital to the lagoon’s ecosystem. 30 years later, a professor at the University of Florida teams up with a well-known deep sea fishing guide to launch the Indian River Clam Restoration Project. After scouring the lagoon and finding ONLY 39 surviving clams, Dr. Todd Osborne and Captain Blair Wiggins—with the help of local residents and businesses—begin carefully breeding “super clams" to restore the dwindling clam population in the Indian River Lagoon. “The Captain &amp; the Super Clams” is more than a human intervention success story; it’s a beautiful buddy film that shows the power of community, science, and technology coming together to find an innovative solution for bio-diversity protection.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20251031225123 +0000" stop="20251031230016 +0000"><title>Rivers are Life</title><desc>Dow employees, their family and friends, and Katie from Rivers are Life join the Ijams Nature Center for their 36th Annual River Rescue in Knoxville, TN.

After bagging two big bucks in just two days with his new Gunwerks Nexus 300 PRC, he is now moving to a new farm where a giant 12-point buck has often been seen in the southeast corner of the property. It’s the coldest day since he arrived, which typically means the deer will be more active. He is thrilled at the prospect of what could be the best day yet. If everything goes well, they will spend the evening hunting hogs from the high rack.</desc></programme><channel id="400000000"><display-name>Waypoint TV</display-name><icon src="https://canvas-lb.tubitv.com/opts/j5_965C-CDR-0w==/4b2bb660-9424-45c9-ad67-9c7099f60cbf/CHgQeDoFMS4xLjhAAQ==" /></channel><programme channel="400000000" start="20251031200001 +0000" stop="20251031203001 +0000"><title>Into The Blue</title><desc>Capt.

Devoid of clams—which naturally filter the water—the lagoon’s water quality rapidly deteriorated as algae blooms went unchecked and sunlight could no longer reach the seagrass that is so vital to the lagoon’s ecosystem. 30 years later, a professor at the University of Florida teams up with a well-known deep sea fishing guide to launch the Indian River Clam Restoration Project. After scouring the lagoon and finding ONLY 39 surviving clams, Dr. Todd Osborne and Captain Blair Wiggins—with the help of local residents and businesses—begin carefully breeding “super clams" to restore the dwindling clam population in the Indian River Lagoon. “The Captain &amp; the Super Clams” is more than a human intervention success story; it’s a beautiful buddy film that shows the power of community, science, and technology coming together to find an innovative solution for bio-diversity protection.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20251031225123 +0000" stop="20251031230016 +0000"><title>Rivers are Life</title><desc>Dow employees, their family and friends, and Katie from Rivers are Life join the Ijams Nature Center for their 36th Annual River Rescue in Knoxville, TN.
