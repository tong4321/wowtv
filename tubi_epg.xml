Six black males had been brutally murdered--two had their hearts cut out.  The only thing connecting the victims was their ethnicity and the fact that each had been shot with .22 caliber bullets. Residents screamed for the police to stop this serial killer.  With no suspects, local investigators turned to the FBI.  Profilers were able to produce a psychological composite of the type of person the killer would most likely be.  Their analysis paid off.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000091" start="20251028132700 +0000" stop="20251028142700 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>In the summer of 1988, a wealthy Jackson, Mississippi woman disappeared from her home in broad daylight.
