As a result, Yami Marik becomes angered, and attacks Odion with the Millennium Rod, which weakens Odion even more. Odion doesn't give up, despite Ishizu's protests. As Marik continues his onslaught (which begins to injure Odion), Odion tells Marik's good side that together, they had conquered his evil half before, and that they could do it again. Then, he tells the good Marik that since Yami Marik was created by the good Marik's hatred, he has the power to destroy him. As Yami Marik raises the Rod to deliver the final blow, the good Marik disappears from the field, and begins fighting against Yami Marik, who struggles for control over Marik's body, and refuses to be defeated. However, Marik's good half stalls Yami Marik long enough for Yugi to activate his spell card. Yugi's Ragnarok spell succeeds in destroying (and removing to the graveyard) Ra, allowing the good Marik to regain control of his body. However, a sliver of Yami Marik reappears on the field, although this time, he is the victim. Yami Marik tries to convince the good Marik to help him seize the Millennium Items and rule the world together, but fails as Marik has decided to stop being evil and make up for his actions. Marik surrenders the duel to Yugi, which sends Yami Marik to the Shadow Realm, ending the Battle City finals. Bakura and Mai are returned from the shadow realm and Marik is reunited with his siblings, who forgive him. Yugi receives the three Egyptian God Cards. Kaiba then activates the Duel Tower's self-destruct sequence, giving everybody one hour to get off the island before it explodes.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000033" start="20260227170000 +0000" stop="20260227173000 +0000"><title>Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's</title><desc>After agreeing to help Yusei meet with Director Goodwin, Officer Trudge unknowingly becomes one of the Dark Signers' drones and challenges a wounded Jack Atlas to a Shadow Duel.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000033" start="20260227173000 +0000" stop="20260227180000 +0000"><title>Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's</title><desc>Hoping to gain Yusei's trust, Director Goodwin decides to share with him the secrets behind the origin of the Satellite Sector and the ongoing war between Signer and Dark Signer.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000033" start="20260227180000 +0000" stop="20260227183000 +0000"><title>Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's</title><desc>After returning to the Satellite Sector, Yusei meets up with his old friend Crow and soon finds himself in a tag team Turbo Duel with Sector Security.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000033" start="20260227183000 +0000" stop="20260227190000 +0000"><title>Talking Tom and Friends</title><desc>Friendship goes bad when Talking Tom’s happy customer service representative turns into a villain.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000033" start="20260227190000 +0000" stop="20260227193000 +0000"><title>Talking Tom and Friends</title><desc>Talking Ginger’s wish is everyone’s command when Talking Tom and Talking Ben’s Assertive App backfires.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000033" start="20260227193000 +0000" stop="20260227200000 +0000"><title>Angry Birds</title><desc>Fun adventure episodes from Angry Birds, Piggy Tales and Stella!
