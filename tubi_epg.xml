Australia is also introduced to a new kind of “violent love”, the Fight Hug.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20251119083238 +0000" stop="20251119092839 +0000"><title>Wipeout Canada</title><desc>20 crazy contestants will face the Donut Run, Donut swing, The Tails and Tippy Tables in this week’s episode.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20251119092839 +0000" stop="20251119102439 +0000"><title>Wipeout Canada</title><desc>Wipeout Canada brings you a countdown of the season's most memorable moments with never-before-seen footage, extended scenes and live interviews with some of the most popular contestants.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20251119102439 +0000" stop="20251119112039 +0000"><title>Wipeout Canada</title><desc>Buoys, Field Goal Swing, Big Donuts and Tippy Tables are some of the over-the-top obstacles in this week’s episode.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20251119112039 +0000" stop="20251119123553 +0000"><title>101 Ways to Leave a Gameshow</title><desc>Steve Jones hosts the series where contestants are ejected in the most nerve-wracking means ever seen on TV.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20251119123553 +0000" stop="20251119134914 +0000"><title>Total Wipeout</title><desc>While the game keeps going, Amanda Byram interviews contestants to find out how they are doing.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20251119134914 +0000" stop="20251119150430 +0000"><title>101 Ways to Leave a Gameshow</title><desc>Steve Jones hosts the series where contestants are ejected in the most nerve-wracking means ever seen on TV.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20251119150430 +0000" stop="20251119161753 +0000"><title>Total Wipeout</title><desc>20 contestants take on four gruelling courses to win the title of Wipeout Champion.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20251119161753 +0000" stop="20251119173314 +0000"><title>Total Wipeout</title><desc>In this episode, contestants face different games like The Qualifier, The Crash Mountain and Dizzy Dummies.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20251119173314 +0000" stop="20251119184623 +0000"><title>Total Wipeout</title><desc>Contestants face different games like The Qualifier, The Crash Mountain, Dizzy Dummies and The Wipeout Zone.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20251119184623 +0000" stop="20251119195724 +0000"><title>Total Wipeout</title><desc>Twenty contestants take on one of television's largest and most extreme obstacle courses.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20251119195724 +0000" stop="20251119211137 +0000"><title>Total Wipeout</title><desc>Twenty contestants take on one of television's largest and most extreme obstacle courses.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20251119211137 +0000" stop="20251119222442 +0000"><title>Total Wipeout</title><desc>This is the last episode of the season and the 7 previous winners compete to be the Champion of Champions.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20251119222442 +0000" stop="20251119231959 +0000"><title>Wipeout Australia</title><desc>This week contestants on Wipeout Australia are bought undone by a seemingly simple obstacle on the Qualifier, the Slippery Stairs.

Led by Cory Redwine, Conservation Director of Project SeaSafe, this is the 4th Annual Clean Water Collective and it’s bigger than ever. This time, we’re in Grant, Florida, where 4 million clams are being released into the Indian River Lagoon, paired with the planting of thousands of mangroves, oyster work by CCA and trash clean ups to help restore one of Florida’s most critical ecosystems. But it’s not just about hard work—it’s about connection. With local captains, fishing legends, and the Local Knowledge crew on hand, we hit the water to show why this place is worth fighting for. From clam drops by drone, to in-water mangrove planting, to monster snook catches, this is hands-on conservation at its best. This two-part series kicks off with action, heart, and the kind of hope only a healthy waterway can bring. Don’t miss Part 1—where conservation meets community and everyone gets their hands wet.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20251118183000 +0000" stop="20251118190000 +0000"><title>Local Knowledge</title><desc>As part of this year's Star brite Sea Safe event, we hit the water to experience some of the incredible fishing the Indian River Lagoon has to offer.
