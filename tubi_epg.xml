First up is Mayfair, with a prime location on the busy seafront in Fuengirola, Costa del Sol. The restaurant was set up 28 years ago by 68 year old Londoner Pat and her husband of 45 years, Jack. The good news is that Fuengirola is one of the only towns in Spain that has actually seen an increase in tourists since the recession with 1 and half million Brits visiting last year alone;  the bad news is that Mayfair isn't benefitting. With thousands of hungry sun seekers right on its doorstep, the restaurant should be raking it in - but the place is totally empty.</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20250719170000 +0000" stop="20250719180000 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>World-renowned chef Gordon Ramsay explores new territory in Ramsay's Costa del Nightmares, a four part series that sees him travel to Europe's holiday hotspots. Episode two sees Gordon tackle struggling Le Deck restaurant in Capbreton, a popular coastal town in South West France.  British owners Tim and Debbie emigrated to France 28 years ago, where they met as holiday reps.  Since then they've poured blood, sweat and tears into opening  3 ski restaurants in the Alps.  With the arrival of their children, they set up home by the coast to enjoy the summer months together as a family.  But unable to sit still, Tim launched Le Deck three years ago.  Far from being a hobby, the restaurant has taken over his life.</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20250719180000 +0000" stop="20250719190000 +0000"><title>The F

Justin Leake and his cousin encounter when December turns unseasonably warm. It’s a grey morning with thick fog so Justin and Capt. Brent Berry won’t be heading offshore right away as planned. Instead, Justin turns to his Humminbird CoastMaster charts to pinpoint a near shore artificial reef just five minutes from the St. Andrews Pass, where the anglers will do a little fishing until the fog burns off. Capt. Leake opts to send a jig to the bottom and he’s not very picky about the one that gets tied on. “When fishing reefs, the specific jig doesn’t matter because it’s all about the presentation,” he says. “When you’re sitting on top of a wreck, break out the ‘junk jigs’ – they get bit just fine.” And that proves to be the case as Justin and Brent enjoy non-stop battles against amberjack, red snapper and bonita. And with a bite this good, there’s no reason to go anywhere else! Also, we take a look at the United States Coast Guard Auxiliary’s new paddle craft safety initiative.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20250719040001 +0000" stop="20250719043000 +0000"><title>Deer and Deer Hunting</title><desc>In this special 20th-anniversary episode, "Deer &amp; Deer Hunting TV" takes a nostalgic journey through two decades of hunting television.

With warmer temps still presenting challenges, Mark and his guide head to a Michon overlooking a pond full of crocodiles. With the temps getting as warm as 90 degrees, the Axis deer search for water to stay hydrated. With time running out on the final day, they catch movement in the brush and a beautiful Axis buck steps out to take a drink.</desc></programme><channel id="400000000"><display-name>Waypoint TV</display-name><icon src="https://canvas-lb.tubitv.com/opts/0nVF3akxrQscZw==/4b2bb660-9424-45c9-ad67-9c7099f60cbf/CHgQeDoFMS4xLjdAAQ==" /></channel><programme channel="400000000" start="20250718200002 +0000" stop="20250718203005 +0000"><title>Into The Blue</title><desc>Captains Scott and Steve go yellow tailing out of Hawks Cay for a limit of tasty yellowtail snapper and Steve picks a battle with a big lemon shark.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20250718203005 +0000" stop="20250718210001 +0000"><title>Into the Blue</title><desc>Captains Scott and Steve bounce around the reefs out of Hawks Cay catching a wide variety of reef dwellers.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20250718210001 +0000" stop="20250718213005 +0000"><title>Into the Blue</title><desc>Captains Scott and Steve take their brand new Invincible 36’ out of Plantation Boat Mart to fly the kites for some early season sailfishing</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20250718213005 +0000" stop="20250718215959 +0000"><title>Into The Blue</title><desc>Captains Scott and Steve make a big run from Plantation Boat Mart in the Invincible 36’into the green Gulf waters to fill the Yeti cooler and battle with some seas monsters.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20250718215959 +0000" stop="20250718223000 +0000"><title>Julie Higgs Spearfishing</title><desc>In the series premiere, Julie embarks on an exhilarating journey to Costa Rica alongside two enthusiastic friends.

Justin Leake and his cousin encounter when December turns unseasonably warm. It’s a grey morning with thick fog so Justin and Capt. Brent Berry won’t be heading offshore right away as planned. Instead, Justin turns to his Humminbird CoastMaster charts to pinpoint a near shore artificial reef just five minutes from the St. Andrews Pass, where the anglers will do a little fishing until the fog burns off. Capt. Leake opts to send a jig to the bottom and he’s not very picky about the one that gets tied on. “When fishing reefs, the specific jig doesn’t matter because it’s all about the presentation,” he says. “When you’re sitting on top of a wreck, break out the ‘junk jigs’ – they get bit just fine.” And that proves to be the case as Justin and Brent enjoy non-stop battles against amberjack, red snapper and bonita. And with a bite this good, there’s no reason to go anywhere else! Also, we take a look at the United States Coast Guard Auxiliary’s new paddle craft safety initiative.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20250719040001 +0000" stop="20250719043000 +0000"><title>Deer and Deer Hunting</title><desc>In this special 20th-anniversary episode, "Deer &amp; Deer Hunting TV" takes a nostalgic journey through two decades of hunting television.
