As always the adventure will end with a feast, right back in Chintan’s kitchen.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20250704153000 +0000" stop="20250704160001 +0000"><title>Dirt</title><desc>For DIRT’s first trip across the pond, host Josh Rosen dove head first into Ireland.

It soon becomes clear someone took a pair of tailor scissors to do the deed, but who amongst the villagers could have done so, is unclear, and the investigation is complicated, when the pair learn the local Anglican priest, the parish vicar, had received a letter from Sonia. When he himself is killed, the pair believe something in the letter may be key to solving the mystery.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20250704050500 +0000" stop="20250704065000 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>Barnaby is not convinced about Mayor David Hicks' plans to revive an annual trip to Brighton, suspecting his proposal to buy coastal land there, is rather a fraudulent scheme.

When Barnaby and Jones start investigating the possible drowning, they discover unsavoury connections to the past that could prove lethal 20 years later, especially when someone attempts to kill.

Meanwhile Kinsella's trainer Teddy Molloy (Phil Daniels) has his own hidden agenda.

The next morning, when Frances Kirby is out for her morning jog, she notices the vintage car they were in up at the airfield, containing Simon Bright's dead body, with Laura nowhere to be seen. Confused, Detective Chief Inspector Barnaby and D.S. Jones can't work out whether it was a suicide pact or murder. Furthermore, they've got to find Miss Sharp and their investigation leads them to linking Simon and Laura with the villagers of Morton Fendle, who met at Elaine Trim's dancing classes.

Things become even more complex when Rex's body is found in a nearby river, bearing wounds that suggest he was murdered. Barnaby and Jones are soon on the case, trying to establish who would have wanted the elderly man dead.

In addition to strife between members of the family, the factory workers are outraged at the loss of their jobs.

Barnaby himself is particularly looking forward to seeing recently re-formed rock band, Hired Gun, perform on stage, but he soon gets close to the band for rather unfortunate reasons. During their opening performance, the band's singer, Mimi (Suzi Quatro), falls to the ground dead - electrocuted by a wire that had been run through the microphone stand. Barnaby and Jones soon find the rest of the band could be targets, and when another is killed, questions are raised as to whether former band member, Ginger Foxton, who went missing for 30 years and is presumed dead, is still at large.

Gordon faces a hellish week, Clubway 41 is breaking every rule in book, can he bring Dave, Dawn and their food back to earth?</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250704195100 +0000" stop="20250704205200 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The Walnut Tree Inn was in big trouble - there was no head chef, the customers had dwindled, and the owner had been forced to sell the family home to keep the business afloat.
Set in beautiful Welsh countryside, The Walnut Tree Inn was a successful business for 37 years and became a national institution. But when Francesco bought the place 3 years ago he made the mistake of turning the warm and welcoming country inn into a cold and stark London-style restaurant. And when things went wrong he tried to run the kitchen as well as the front of house.
With its Michelin star in jeopardy, Ramsay's first job was to recruit a new head chef so the owner could concentrate on customers. But has Francesco managed to follow Ramsay's advice and stop meddling in the kitchen?</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250704205200 +0000" stop="20250704215300 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>In tonight's program Gordon Ramsay travels to the seaside to help ailing hotel and restaurant, The Sandgate. This is Lois and Peter's first venture into the catering industry - the happily married couple used to enjoy eating in restaurants, so thought it might be fun to own one. 18months later their dream has turned into a nightmare and they're loosing ~£4,000 a month.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250704215300 +0000" stop="20250704225300 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>This week Gordon is at a god-awful Italian restaurant in Derby. La Gondola is stuck in a time-warp with naff Seventies cuisine, bad net curtains and no customers. New owner Daniela bought the place because she got married there back in the day but her sentimentality has blinded her to the fact that she's bagged a white elephant. Gordon's biggest problem is head chef Steve, one of the worst he's ever met, and one who'd rather open a tin of tuna or a packet of soup than create a proper meal. Can Gordon get the kitchen cooking again and save La Gondala from sinking?</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250704225300 +0000" stop="20250704235500 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The venue for tonight's first programme is La Lanterna in Letchworth, Hertfordshire. Twenty-eight-year-old owner and head chef Alex offers modern Italian cuisine, a taste of Little Italy in England's first garden city, and the restaurant is run by his best mate maitre dé Gavin, helped by his ex-air hostess girlfriend Emily. But Alex has no customers, cookers that don't work and an expensive menu that's about as authentically Italian as a spag bol.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250704235500 +0000" stop="20250705005500 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The venue for tonight's second programme is D-Place in Chelmsford, Essex run by Mexican-born Israel and his English partner Tara. They've sunk ~£150,000 of their own money into their trendy café bar which offers a vast selection of fusion cuisine. In charge is Executive Chef Philippe, producing everything from all-day breakfasts to hoi sin noodles with an astounding lack of flair; the plastic food is dire and boomerangs back from the dining room as soon as it's cooked.</desc></programme><channel id="715948"><display-name>Family Unscripted</display-name><icon src="https://canvas-lb.tubitv.com/opts/VMNlSKleecHNvw==/6ea6276d-0cdb-4348-a68f-5b6cc575c8cb/CHgQeDoFMS4xLjdAAQ==" /></channel><programme channel="715948" start="20250703081930 +0000" stop="20250703090905 +0000"><title>Little People, Big World</title><desc>With wedding season fast approaching, the family prepares the farm.</desc></programme><programme channel="715948" start="20250703090905 +0000" stop="20250703095740 +0000"><title>Little People, Big World</title><desc>Zach challenges his parents to spend 24 hours tethered together!</desc></programme><programme channel="715948" start="20250703095740 +0000" stop="20250703104815 +0000"><title>Little People, Big World</title><desc>The Roloffs plan to make the third wedding of the season magical!</desc></programme><programme channel="715948" start="20250703104815 +0000" stop="20250703113649 +0000"><title>Little People, Big World</title><desc>Matt feels a pre-fab home is the best option for the bridal suite.</desc></programme><programme channel="715948" start="20250703113649 +0000" stop="20250703122524 +0000"><title>Little People, Big World</title><desc>Rain threatens to put a damper on a wedding couple's big day.</desc></programme><programme channel="715948" start="20250703122524 +0000" stop="20250703125040 +0000"><title>Cake Boss</title><desc>The Carlo's team heads to a museum on a research mission.</desc></programme><programme channel="715948" start="20250703125040 +0000" stop="20250703131645 +0000"><title>Cake Boss</title><desc>The team at Carlo's is asked to make a huge roulette table cake.</desc></programme><programme channel="715948" start="20250703131645 +0000" stop="20250703134202 +0000"><title>Cake Boss</title><desc>Buddy has to create a Leaning Tower of Pisa wedding cake.</desc></programme><programme channel="715948" start="20250703134202 +0000" stop="20250703140718 +0000"><title>Cake Boss</title><desc>Buddy learns that where there's smoke, there's fire.</desc></programme><programme channel="715948" start="20250703140718 +0000" stop="20250703143251 +0000"><title>Cake Boss</title><desc>Buddy is excited to create a tall, ornate wedding cake filled with birds!</desc></programme><programme channel="715948" start="20250703143251 +0000" stop="20250703145808 +0000"><title>Cake Boss</title><desc>The team makes a special cake featuring fireworks.</desc></programme><programme channel="715948" start="20250703145808 +0000" stop="20250703152339 +0000"><title>Cake Boss</title><desc>It's one of the busiest weeks of the year at Carlo's Bakery.</desc></programme><programme channel="715948" start="20250703152339 +0000" stop="20250703154840 +0000"><title>Cake Boss</title><desc>The team works on an FAO Schwarz-themed cake and a beach-themed cake.</desc></programme><programme channel="715948" start="20250703154840 +0000" stop="20250703161410 +0000"><title>Cake Boss</title><desc>The bakery deals with a zombie cake and an erotic cake in the same week.</desc></programme><programme channel="715948" start="20250703161410 +0000" stop="20250703163725 +0000"><title>Cake Boss</title><desc>A bridezilla makes everyone's life difficult and Stretch plots revenge.</desc></programme><programme channel="715948" start="20250703163725 +0000" stop="20250703170259 +0000"><title>Cake Boss</title><desc>Buddy gets a call from a customer he cannot possibly turn down.</desc></programme><programme channel="715948" start="20250703170259 +0000" stop="20250703172816 +0000"><title>Cake Boss</title><desc>The team's working on a traditional Chinese dragon cake.</desc></programme><programme channel="715948" start="20250703172816 +0000" stop="20250703175328 +0000"><title>Cake Boss</title><desc>Buddy's asked to make a tiki cake that spits fire.</desc></programme><programme channel="715948" start="20250703175328 +0000" stop="20250703181901 +0000"><title>Here Comes Honey Boo Boo</title><desc>The family gets a pool, and June searches for a new hairpiece for Alana.</desc></programme><programme channel="715948" start="20250703181901 +0000" stop="20250703184223 +0000"><title>Here Comes Honey Boo Boo</title><desc>Alana meets a new pageant coach, and the family throws a baby shower.</desc></programme><programme channel="715948" start="20250703184223 +0000" stop="20250703190456 +0000"><title>Here Comes Honey Boo Boo</title><desc>June and the girls visit the spa.
