Led by Cory Redwine, Conservation Director of Project SeaSafe, this is the 4th Annual Clean Water Collective and it’s bigger than ever. This time, we’re in Grant, Florida, where 4 million clams are being released into the Indian River Lagoon, paired with the planting of thousands of mangroves, oyster work by CCA and trash clean ups to help restore one of Florida’s most critical ecosystems. But it’s not just about hard work—it’s about connection. With local captains, fishing legends, and the Local Knowledge crew on hand, we hit the water to show why this place is worth fighting for. From clam drops by drone, to in-water mangrove planting, to monster snook catches, this is hands-on conservation at its best. This two-part series kicks off with action, heart, and the kind of hope only a healthy waterway can bring.

But in order to investigate the matter further, Jones is forced to work undercover, and infiltrate the local group of Freemasons in the village.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20250828082100 +0000" stop="20250828100900 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>The music lovers of Midsomer County are delighted when a host of bands arrives for the Midsomer Rocks festival. Barnaby himself is particularly looking forward to seeing recently re-formed rock band, Hired Gun, perform on stage, but he soon gets close to the band for rather unfortunate reasons. During their opening performance, the band's singer, Mimi (Suzi Quatro), falls to the ground dead - electrocuted by a wire that had been run through the microphone stand. Barnaby and Jones soon find the rest of the band could be targets, and when another is killed, questions are raised as to whether former band member, Ginger Foxton, who went missing for 30 years and is presumed dead, is still at large. The detectives soon have to delve into a world of rock music, drug use and greed, to find the truth.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20250828100900 +0000" stop="20250828115700 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>The suspicious death of popular young GP Dr Alan Delaney brings Barnaby and Jones to Midsomer Market to investigate. The detectives are baffled as to a motive for murder - until they consider that the newly engaged Dr James Kirkwood may have been the intended victim. Before long, Barnaby and Jones are heading to Wales - former home to Delyth Mostyn, James's fiancee, to delve deeper into the mystery. There are certainly possible suspects in the murder and attempt on Kirkwood, from Delyth's children, who oppose the engagement, Delyth's husband, and more, as the detectives investigate things, in hopes of uncovering the truth before a major walk is to take place on Mount Snowdon.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20250828115700 +0000" stop="20250828134800 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>In the build-up to Luxton Deeping's annual photographic exhibition, a battle rages between the traditional and digital photographers of the pretty village. The dispute seems harmless enough - until Lionel Bell is found murdered in a nearby woodland, strangled with the cord of his light meter. Barnaby soon gets to work tracking down the killer, but it seems someone is trying to implicate the detective in the murder. And once he is replaced on the case, finding the culprit seems less likely than ever, as his replacement is more concerned of an upcoming wedding than the investigation. Barnaby is forced to work off the case to uncover who is framing him, and who wants dead other photographers in the village.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20250828134800 +0000" stop="20250828153600 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>The residents of Midsomer Magna are thrilled when a production crew arrives at the local manor house to film a version of The Scarlet Pimpernel. But the crew members aren't the only visitors to the area - Jones has spotted notorious criminal George Ince nearby. But when the director, Nick Cheney, is found dead - his head severed by a prop guillotine - Barnaby must discover who would have wanted the victim dead. It soon becomes clear that things are not so simple, and the detectives soon have to shift through varying motives, layered by lies, hidden truths, and a possible robbery to be committed.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20250828153600 +0000" stop="20250828172600 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>Barnaby is in Midsomer Holm, bidding farewell to reformed criminal Ronnie Tyler, who has taken part in a rehabilitation scheme in the village. Also present is disgraced ex-policeman Jack Colby, a former colleague of Barnaby's – but Jack refuses to talk to his old friend. When Jack is murdered, the detective must delve into the dark secrets in the victim's past. There are certainly dark secrets to uncover, and Barnaby has to determine whether the victim's part in a scandal years earlier at Causton police station, is key to the mystery behind his death. It isn't long before he finds that Eddie Marston is attempting blackmail, and soon murdered as a result, and that Lord Holm is in love with Jack's wife, psychotherapist Gina.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20250828172600 +0000" stop="20250828191400 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>The ghost village of Little Auburn has been abandoned since the war.
