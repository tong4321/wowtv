If jumping a revolving arm while balancing on a pedestal above water isn’t enough for you then you’ll love this weeks Sweeper. Contestants are armed with Dodgeballs, to be deployed at each other, creating horrific hits and spectacular spills. The Dizzy Dummy claims its first victim as Dummy Tummy rejects a contestant and the Wipeout Zone becomes a battle of young and old.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20251226040727 +0000" stop="20251226050147 +0000"><title>Wipeout Australia</title><desc>It’s no doubt that the ‘Ball Crusher’ Sweeper is the star of tonight’s show. With a brother- sister team hanging by a thread and a three-way hurdle, this week’s Sweeper writes itself into the History books. Tonight is also the night we meet Buffman, a pint sized Superhero with a twitch and a photo finish at the Dizzy Dummy threatens extinction to a Rare Breed. A week of action packed Wipeouts with Latin Dancing lotharios, what more can you ask for?

The lucky 12 that move through, battle it out with a giant toothbrush Sweeper. ‘Nat with the Tats’ and Renee ‘Lets get physical’ move through to the Dreadmill, flying the banner for the ladies. Look out for Scotty Six Toes at the Big Balls and get the ear plugs ready as you meet Herr Chris.

This time, they’re diving into the Kansai region—where millennia-old traditions flow from the shore of Lake Biwa to surf breaks on the coast. Chef Coleman Griffin gives them a taste of the deep cultural immersion that inspires his culinary practice, from chef knives descended from samurai swords to fermented carp that went on to spawn sushi. And turns out, the perfect meal does exist, and the crew knew it as soon as they had a bite of their final omakase.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20251226154446 +0000" stop="20251226163305 +0000"><title>Dirt</title><desc>Guadalajara’s heritage runs deep. On the DIRT crew’s latest adventure, they explored the region’s rich history from volcanic highlands to secret surf coves. Chefs Xrysw Ruelas and Óscar Segundo sent Josh and co. to load up on locally grown coffee, spearfish between catching waves, and follow freshly harvested agave on its journey to becoming tequila. After learning the ropes of Mexico’s national sport, Charreria, and hitting up a Lucha Libre match, all the local flavors came together in a feast backed by thousands of years of tradition. There really is something special in the soil here.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20251226163305 +0000" stop="20251226170026 +0000"><title>Dirt</title><desc>In Episode 3, Josh starts off in the Twin Cities where he meets up with Yia Vang, an award-winning Hmong chef and restaurant owner, bringing his family’s traditions and flavors to the American Midwest.
