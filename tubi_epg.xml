Our families have been close for man years and shared a lot of time together around the soccer field, vacations, fishing trips, and much more. Nathan passed in a tragic car accident at only 18 years on April 29th, 2023. This week his Dad Brian is joining me on Lake Taylorsville where we'll share some memories and celebrate Nathan's life...that ended way to soon!</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20250909173003 +0000" stop="20250909180002 +0000"><title>The Direction</title><desc>This week we're joined by our good friend and Worship Leader, Rob Key.
