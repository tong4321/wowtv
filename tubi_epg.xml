Teaming up with Florida Sea Grant, University of Florida, Gulf States Marine Fisheries Commission, NOAA, and a diverse coalition of partners, the project delivers training, equipment, and research funding to tackle depredation and release mortality issues. Moreover, it evaluates the efficacy of descending devices, ultimately promoting improved fish survival, a more robust fishery, and enriched angling experiences across the Gulf of Mexico.This podcast is presented by Black Rifle Coffee Use code BLASTOFF25 for 25% offSalt Strong Insiders Club: https://bit.ly/RowlandMembershipLMNT Electrolytes Special Offer: http://DrinkLMNT.com/TomRowlandIf you have questions or suggestions for the show you can text Tom at 1 305-930-7346This episode has been brought to you by Waypoint TV.

Get an inside look at a man that many consider to be larger than life, from those that knew him best, like his cousin and fellow hell raiser, Bud McCollum. We’ll even hear a story or two from Milton Stovesand, an 81 year old former waterfowl guide and Mack’s employee who actually guided John Olin a time or two, and ran the timber holes with Marion. It’s timber holes and tall tales. It’s cups of coffee and cupped up wings. It’s partners in business, and partners in potholes and it’s pure Arkansas...just like Marion.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20251013200002 +0000" stop="20251013203001 +0000"><title>Winchester Life</title><desc>Melissa Bachman has made her name over the last two decades as one of the most dedicated hunters and producers in the outdoor industry.

While there was evidence he was desperately seeking to avoid bankruptcy, and had visited a local millionaire to get back his money from a scheme he had invested in, a post mortem reveals that he had been murdered. The two detectives soon find their investigations crossing over, when a man found to have an illegal collection of bird eggs, is also murdered, prompting concerns that the millionaire's scheme is being used to defraud many, and that someone is willing to kill to keep the scheme going.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20251013161200 +0000" stop="20251013180000 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>No one could suspect that a prestigious golf club would be the setting for murder, but when one of the major members is found dead, bludgeoned to death in a thicket next to the 13th hole, Barnaby and Jones try to determine what made him leave the fairway. It seems the club has a rift between the snobbish members, and local villagers, the latter only allowed onto the course for a few hours a week. Before long, another member turns up dead, and the detectives soon find the club has a hidden history, involving gambling, illegal money lending and assault, prompting the pair to determine if a club member, or one of its staff, is responsible for the deeds.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20251013180000 +0000" stop="20251013194800 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>A newly discovered masterpiece by landscape artist Henry Hogson causes a stir when it is auctioned for  £400,000 - just hours before its former owner is tortured and killed.
