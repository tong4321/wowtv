His family quickly fling accusations for his murder directly at the residents of rival village, Lower Warden, leading Barnaby and Troy to determine if this is the case, especially when Larry's director, another member of the family, is electrocuted while using an exercise bike. It's not long before secrets, affairs and blackmail begin to surface from within the two villages.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20251129114500 +0000" stop="20251129134300 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>While Troy assists an attractive wildlife liaison officer with an investigation into the illegal sale of protected bird eggs, Barnaby travels to Midsomer Magna to investigate the sudden death of a man, who apparently drowned himself. While there was evidence he was desperately seeking to avoid bankruptcy, and had visited a local millionaire to get back his money from a scheme he had invested in, a post mortem reveals that he had been murdered. The two detectives soon find their investigations crossing over, when a man found to have an illegal collection of bird eggs, is also murdered, prompting concerns that the millionaire's scheme is being used to defraud many, and that someone is willing to kill to keep the scheme going.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20251129134300 +0000" stop="20251129154300 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>Barnaby and Troy tackle two separate cases as Troy prepares to leave Midsomer after his promotion to DI.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20251129154300 +0000" stop="20251129174300 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>Barnaby's new Sergeant arrives on the day after the murder of a local shrew occurs, and he is immediately put to work.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20251129174300 +0000" stop="20251129193900 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>Long-suppressed family secrets, stolen ancient artefacts, and a thirty year old death at a Celtic burial site result in a series of murders in present day Midsomer.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20251129193900 +0000" stop="20251129213200 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>When Midsomer hosts its 12th Annual Literary Festival, an author is found with his neck broken.
