Confused, Detective Chief Inspector Barnaby and D.S. Jones can't work out whether it was a suicide pact or murder. Furthermore, they've got to find Miss Sharp and their investigation leads them to linking Simon and Laura with the villagers of Morton Fendle, who met at Elaine Trim's dancing classes.

During their opening performance, the band's singer, Mimi (Suzi Quatro), falls to the ground dead - electrocuted by a wire that had been run through the microphone stand. Barnaby and Jones soon find the rest of the band could be targets, and when another is killed, questions are raised as to whether former band member, Ginger Foxton, who went missing for 30 years and is presumed dead, is still at large.

The kidnappers contact the victim's family and demand $30,000, but offer no instructions on how to transfer the money.  The victim's family contacts the police.  The boy's captors tell his family they have shot him, and will kill him if they do not receive their money.  At an agreed upon drop site, FBI agents approach the captor's vehicle, only to watch them flee and quickly be followed by authorities.</desc></programme><programme channel="682630" start="20250714000000 +0000" stop="20250714010000 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>In the early 90s, Washington, D.C. police were losing the battle against street gangs who enforced their territories with lethal violence.  The homicide rate in the nation's capital climbed to the highest in the country.  Local police turned to the FBI for help, but agents soon found themselves in the direct line of fire.  In the fall of 1994, a gang member walked into police headquarters, killed two FBI agents and one detective, then turned the gun on himself.</desc></programme><programme channel="682630" start="20250714010000 +0000" stop="20250714020000 +0000"><title>Los Archivos del FBI (Doblado)</title><desc>El 21 de junio de 1964, tres defensores de los derechos civiles, uno blanco y uno negro, desaparecieron de Mississippi mientras cruzaban el condado de Neshoba.

Los laboratorios del FBI confirmaron que todas excepto una de las balas usadas para asesinar a los hombres provenían de la misma arma.

Left behind was a mysterious ransom note listing twelve names and no specific instructions.  The note, and a few drops of blood were the only clues to her fate. FBI and local police struggled to find answers in the cryptic message so they could find the kidnapper and retrieve the victim before her time ran out. Solving the crime required the keen insight of a criminal profiler and the perseverance of a family, local authorities, and the FBI.</desc></programme><programme channel="682630" start="20250714030000 +0000" stop="20250714040000 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>In June of 2000, two gunmen rob a Seattle, WA bank, and flee on foot as officers chase them.
