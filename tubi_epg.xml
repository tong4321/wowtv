Get an inside look at a man that many consider to be larger than life, from those that knew him best, like his cousin and fellow hell raiser, Bud McCollum. We’ll even hear a story or two from Milton Stovesand, an 81 year old former waterfowl guide and Mack’s employee who actually guided John Olin a time or two, and ran the timber holes with Marion. It’s timber holes and tall tales. It’s cups of coffee and cupped up wings. It’s partners in business, and partners in potholes and it’s pure Arkansas...just like Marion.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20251024130001 +0000" stop="20251024133000 +0000"><title>Winchester Life</title><desc>Melissa Bachman has made her name over the last two decades as one of the most dedicated hunters and producers in the outdoor industry.
