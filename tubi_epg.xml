This one-of-a-kind home now serves as a gathering place for creatives and surfers alike, nestled between the forest and Oregon coast.On Huckberry Homes, we’ll be tapping into the most inspiring members of the Huckberry community to offer an inside peek into how they’ve crafted the place they call home. We will showcase everything from cold plunges to vinyl listening rooms, home gyms and offices, and other tools that inspire creativity and high-performing lives.We would like to take a moment to acknowledge the Indigenous peoples who have stewarded the land on which this video was created. This area was the home to the Nestucca peoples and other coastal tribes until the mid-1800s when the population was decimated by diseases from settlers. Those who remained were coerced into a coastal reservation by the US government.

Second only to Alaska in size, Texas is known as the place where everything is bigger. From big college football games to endless oil fields and vast wind farms, Texas is home to more than 30 million Americans. But the state is about more than just big oil, college football and cattle farms - it's also home to some of the best boating in the country. Boasting a myriad of waterways, boaters here enjoy hundreds of lakes, rivers and streams that provide recreational opportunities, abundant wildlife and plenty of fishing. From Austin Texas to San Antonio host Ryan McVinney and the Boat Trader crew explore the laid-back Texas lake life including boat up restaurants along the Colorado River, watersports in Austin and the history of the waterways throughout the region. Boat manufacturers highlighted in this episode are Tige Boats and ATX Surf Boats, two premium Texas-based wake boat brands known for their high-quality, cutting-edge vessels that come equipped with advanced wake shaping technologies and equipment ideal for water skiing, wake surfing and wakeboarding.

Justin Leake and his cousin encounter when December turns unseasonably warm. It’s a grey morning with thick fog so Justin and Capt. Brent Berry won’t be heading offshore right away as planned. Instead, Justin turns to his Humminbird CoastMaster charts to pinpoint a near shore artificial reef just five minutes from the St. Andrews Pass, where the anglers will do a little fishing until the fog burns off. Capt. Leake opts to send a jig to the bottom and he’s not very picky about the one that gets tied on. “When fishing reefs, the specific jig doesn’t matter because it’s all about the presentation,” he says. “When you’re sitting on top of a wreck, break out the ‘junk jigs’ – they get bit just fine.” And that proves to be the case as Justin and Brent enjoy non-stop battles against amberjack, red snapper and bonita. And with a bite this good, there’s no reason to go anywhere else! Also, we take a look at the United States Coast Guard Auxiliary’s new paddle craft safety initiative.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20260204070000 +0000" stop="20260204073001 +0000"><title>The Green Way Outdoors</title><desc>Kyle and Jeff hear about the dangers of fishing for Bluefin Tuna in the Atlantic Ocean from locals in Gloucester, Massachusetts.

Second only to Alaska in size, Texas is known as the place where everything is bigger. From big college football games to endless oil fields and vast wind farms, Texas is home to more than 30 million Americans. But the state is about more than just big oil, college football and cattle farms - it's also home to some of the best boating in the country. Boasting a myriad of waterways, boaters here enjoy hundreds of lakes, rivers and streams that provide recreational opportunities, abundant wildlife and plenty of fishing. From Austin Texas to San Antonio host Ryan McVinney and the Boat Trader crew explore the laid-back Texas lake life including boat up restaurants along the Colorado River, watersports in Austin and the history of the waterways throughout the region. Boat manufacturers highlighted in this episode are Tige Boats and ATX Surf Boats, two premium Texas-based wake boat brands known for their high-quality, cutting-edge vessels that come equipped with advanced wake shaping technologies and equipment ideal for water skiing, wake surfing and wakeboarding. There's even a wake surfing dog!</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20260204033011 +0000" stop="20260204040007 +0000"><title>Ship Shape TV</title><desc>During this episode of Ship Shape TV Essentials the SSTV team does a deep dive into a product founded by Engineered Marine Coatings called the Genius Bucket.

Justin Leake and his cousin encounter when December turns unseasonably warm. It’s a grey morning with thick fog so Justin and Capt. Brent Berry won’t be heading offshore right away as planned. Instead, Justin turns to his Humminbird CoastMaster charts to pinpoint a near shore artificial reef just five minutes from the St. Andrews Pass, where the anglers will do a little fishing until the fog burns off. Capt. Leake opts to send a jig to the bottom and he’s not very picky about the one that gets tied on. “When fishing reefs, the specific jig doesn’t matter because it’s all about the presentation,” he says. “When you’re sitting on top of a wreck, break out the ‘junk jigs’ – they get bit just fine.” And that proves to be the case as Justin and Brent enjoy non-stop battles against amberjack, red snapper and bonita. And with a bite this good, there’s no reason to go anywhere else! Also, we take a look at the United States Coast Guard Auxiliary’s new paddle craft safety initiative.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20260204070000 +0000" stop="20260204073001 +0000"><title>The Green Way Outdoors</title><desc>Kyle and Jeff hear about the dangers of fishing for Bluefin Tuna in the Atlantic Ocean from locals in Gloucester, Massachusetts.

Confused, Detective Chief Inspector Barnaby and D.S. Jones can't work out whether it was a suicide pact or murder. Furthermore, they've got to find Miss Sharp and their investigation leads them to linking Simon and Laura with the villagers of Morton Fendle, who met at Elaine Trim's dancing classes.

Barnaby and Jones are soon on the case, trying to establish who would have wanted the elderly man dead. Several people soon come forward with multiple wills, which confuse the matter, but when two more people, close friends of Rex, are also murdered, the investigation raises question on the motive, leading Barnaby to wonder if it was down to finances, passion, or something from Rex's past.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20260204121500 +0000" stop="20260204140500 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>Following the death of Alan King while on a business trip to China, the family company, King's Crystal, is in financial trouble.

During their opening performance, the band's singer, Mimi (Suzi Quatro), falls to the ground dead - electrocuted by a wire that had been run through the microphone stand. Barnaby and Jones soon find the rest of the band could be targets, and when another is killed, questions are raised as to whether former band member, Ginger Foxton, who went missing for 30 years and is presumed dead, is still at large.

There are certainly possible suspects in the murder and attempt on Kirkwood, from Delyth's children, who oppose the engagement, Delyth's husband, and more, as the detectives investigate things, in hopes of uncovering the truth before a major walk is to take place on Mount Snowdon.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20260204174200 +0000" stop="20260204193200 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>In the build-up to Luxton Deeping's annual photographic exhibition, a battle rages between the traditional and digital photographers of the pretty village.

There are certainly dark secrets to uncover, and Barnaby has to determine whether the victim's part in a scandal years earlier at Causton police station, is key to the mystery behind his death. It isn't long before he finds that Eddie Marston is attempting blackmail, and soon murdered as a result, and that Lord Holm is in love with Jack's wife, psychotherapist Gina.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20260204231100 +0000" stop="20260205005300 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>The demise of the Shirewell patriarch sparks a vicious inheritance dispute when eldest son Lucian announces plans to break up an estate that's been in his family for centuries.</desc></programme><channel id="671073"><display-name>Unsolved Mysteries</display-name><icon src="https://canvas-lb.tubitv.com/opts/5DVrF33Bfks10w==/864892f9-3ab0-4950-9f8b-189ec2d92c20/CHgQeDoFMS4xLjhAAQ==" /></channel><programme channel="671073" start="20260203200400 +0000" stop="20260203210200 +0000"><title>Unsolved Mysteries With Robert Stack</title><desc>This episode includes: Battling for Her Brother &amp;
