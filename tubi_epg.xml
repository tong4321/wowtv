Posing as a fashion photographer, Christopher Wilder lured young women from shopping malls with promises of fame and fortune.  Most ended up dead.  As the FBI closed in around him, Wilder took off on a cross-country murderous rampage.  The FBI added Wilder to their Most Wanted Fugitives program.  The chase was on, and Wilder ultimately lost.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000091" start="20251026160000 +0000" stop="20251026165600 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>On August 20, 1980, an unseen sniper murdered two young black men as they jogged with two white women in Salt Lake City, Utah.  Police threw all their resources into finding a killer who left almost no clues behind.  They met with FBI agents and detectives from around the country who had similar racially motivated sniper slayings.  A month later, working off little more than a possible license plate number, police in Kentucky arrested Joseph Paul Franklin but the man escaped from custody.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000091" start="20251026165600 +0000" stop="20251026165900 +0000"><title>Program information currently unavailable.</title></programme><programme channel="400000091" start="20251026165900 +0000" stop="20251026175600 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>In the summer of 1988, a wealthy Jackson, Mississippi woman disappeared from her home in broad daylight.
