One of which has a very huge part of Trent's heart being it is his biggest buck to date! Mufasa was a 226" buck that was on his In-laws farm. That hunt and property obviously became very special to him. From that moment Trent dreamed of owning a property just like it to try and grow even more deer of this caliber on his own. After starting his career with Midwest Land group Trent was able to create enough income to purchase his first ever farm, which happened to be the exact farm he killed his biggest buck "Mufasa" on. Trent made the farm his own and was very excited to hunt it for the very first time as the land owner. In the very same stand he released his arrow in for Mufasa he kills on his first hunt of the year and connects with his top target buck! An insane full circle of events makes this story one that Trent will never forget.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20260111010013 +0000" stop="20260111013013 +0000"><title>Hunting Land Man</title><desc>Opening day in Mississippi has arrived and Slade is taking full advantage of it!

One of which has a very huge part of Trent's heart being it is his biggest buck to date! Mufasa was a 226" buck that was on his In-laws farm. That hunt and property obviously became very special to him. From that moment Trent dreamed of owning a property just like it to try and grow even more deer of this caliber on his own. After starting his career with Midwest Land group Trent was able to create enough income to purchase his first ever farm, which happened to be the exact farm he killed his biggest buck "Mufasa" on. Trent made the farm his own and was very excited to hunt it for the very first time as the land owner. In the very same stand he released his arrow in for Mufasa he kills on his first hunt of the year and connects with his top target buck! An insane full circle of events makes this story one that Trent will never forget.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20260111010013 +0000" stop="20260111013013 +0000"><title>Hunting Land Man</title><desc>Opening day in Mississippi has arrived and Slade is taking full advantage of it!

It always heated up as the season progressed, and on his very first morning sit, the action unfolded fast. A good buck came cruising from the South in search of a doe. At 60 yards he started to turn away, but the Intimidator grunt call changed everything. With a few calls from the Intimidator, he spun around from 150 yards, worked a scrape at 40 yards, and walked right into range!</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20260111034918 +0000" stop="20260111040001 +0000"><title>The WoodHaven Way</title><desc>In Missouri, we join Avery Epperson on the home farm with one goal in mind—catching up with a legendary buck known as Old Monroe.

We’ll even hear a story or two from Milton Stovesand, an 81 year old former waterfowl guide and Mack’s employee who actually guided John Olin a time or two, and ran the timber holes with Marion. It’s timber holes and tall tales. It’s cups of coffee and cupped up wings.
