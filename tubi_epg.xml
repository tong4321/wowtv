But if the One gets a question wrong, he is eliminated and the remaining mob members split his winnings.</desc></programme><programme channel="673411" start="20250918141600 +0000" stop="20250918144200 +0000"><title>Tug of Words</title><desc>Based on the playground game Tug-O-War, teams of two compete to answer word-clue questions correctly and pull the flag on the tug of war rope to their side.</desc></programme><programme channel="673411" start="20250918144200 +0000" stop="20250918150800 +0000"><title>Tug of Words</title><desc>Based on the playground game Tug-O-War, teams of two compete to answer word-clue questions correctly and pull the flag on the tug of war rope to their side.</desc></programme><programme channel="673411" start="20250918150800 +0000" stop="20250918153300 +0000"><title>Family Feud</title><desc>Steve Harvey assumes the hosting duties for this daytime game show in which five members of one family are pitted against five members of another family.

only get some amazing hunting property, but to have other people pay for it. Sound too good to be true? We also take you on some great hunts we’ve had on our journey flipping land and think back on some memories from the past and what the future is going to look like.

We developed our last farm, and did a 1031 tax free exchange to buy this farm so we can develop and sell it later on. This is the first time we’ve seen the property, so we are finding out what we are going to do with it and how we are going to lay it out. Once we get that figured out, we go into the dirty work of planting, moving box stands, and making sure everything is good for hunting season. Fast forward and we have two amazing hunts where both Ryan and myself take awesome bucks with our bows. This one has it all! Do not miss it!</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20250917170015 +0000" stop="20250917173030 +0000"><title>Hunting Land Man</title><desc>In this episode, Slade takes you on a ride through one of the coolest cities in the south, the historic Natchez, Mississippi.
