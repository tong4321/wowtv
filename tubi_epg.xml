Most of the hourlong episodes feature an interview with a single guest who gets grilled by Green and viewers, who are able to ask questions through video chat software. Each episode's initial broadcast airs live, allowing for a deeper look into the guest's life that might not be seen on other talk shows that edit interviews before they air. "Tom Green Live" also features less of a comedic atmosphere than his previous efforts.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000169" start="20250807174500 +0000" stop="20250807184500 +0000"><title>Steve Brown: Yeah, I Talk Like This</title><desc>The high-pitched, high-energy voice of comedian Steve Brown is exactly how he talks in his first outrageous comedy set shot live in New York City.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000169" start="20250807184500 +0000" stop="20250807191500 +0000"><title>K-Von: Designer Muscles</title><desc>Raised by a religious family in Las Vegas, half-Persian comedian K-von is an expert at removing a bad word from a joke while keeping it funny.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000169" start="20250807191500 +0000" stop="20250807201500 +0000"><title>Gary Owen: Breakin' Out the Park</title><desc>In this brutally honest stand-up performance, comedian Gary Owen confesses his hilarious history of growing up in and around trailer parks.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000169" start="20250807201500 +0000" stop="20250807213000 +0000"><title>Gary Owen: #DoinWhatIDo</title><desc>The so-called “Funniest Serviceman in America” draws from his multiracial experience to lambast culture wars on social media and in his own home.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000169" start="20250807213000 +0000" stop="20250807224000 +0000"><title>Gary Owen: Black Famous</title><desc>This last year has been unlike any other: COVID, lockdowns, and for Gary, it has also included a divorce and family insanity unlike any other; up until now, Gary hasn't been able to speak about what really happened.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000169" start="20250807224000 +0000" stop="20250807234000 +0000"><title>Lavell Crawford: I Could Eat - Part 1</title><desc>Lavell Crawford is back and here to contemplate how "My 600 Pound Life" could go for 15 seasons and he was still underweight, the kind of racist you have to be to not take a free holiday, and explosive consequences in a Taco Bell bathroom.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000169" start="20250807234000 +0000" stop="20250808005000 +0000"><title>Lavell Crawford: Home for the Holidays</title><desc>The comic performs in St. Louis, discussing Christmas as a child, feeling guilty on Mother's Day, Thanksgiving and Disneyland.</desc></programme><channel id="658746"><display-name>The Johnny Carson Show</display-name><icon src="https://canvas-lb.tubitv.com/opts/RZtacPj-Ofpc6g==/c468221e-d75c-428a-bfaa-cdb5277c4c3b/CHgQeDoFMS4xLjhAAQ==" /></channel><programme channel="658746" start="20250806013000 +0000" stop="20250806023000 +0000"><title>The Johnny Carson Show</title><desc>Whipped cream anyone?
