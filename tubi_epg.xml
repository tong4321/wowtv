It marked the beginning of a four-year crime wave that rocked Seattle.  With each new robbery, the bandits perfected their craft, leaving behind no evidence and escaping with hundreds and thousands of dollars.

The effort put them face to face with an armed and desperate fugitive.</desc></programme><programme channel="682630" start="20251020020000 +0000" stop="20251020030000 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>In the late 1980s, the FBI matches wits with a cunning bank robber -- a lone gunman responsible for the longest string of unsolved bank robberies in FBI history.
