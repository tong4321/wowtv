Join pioneers like Gretchen Bleiler, Bode Miller, Andreas Hatveit, Mathias Roten, Ueli Kestenholz, and numerous others as they travel around the world from Chile all the way to the sand dunes of Dubai, up to Sweden and the peaks of the Swiss Alps. This year’s invigorating action display includes: a rare and insightful segment on ski racing king and perceived industry bad boy, Bode Miller; a trip to Alaska’s untouched Chugach Range with X-Games Gold Medalists, and brothers, Zach and Reggie Crist; unbelievably deep powder in Utah and British Columbia; and astonishing aerial acrobatics from Sweden, and so much more. PLAYGROUND also highlights the future of snowboarding in a segment featuring the youth-infused Burton Smalls Team in which these young prodigies teach us that size truly isn’t everything.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000005" start="20250625080000 +0000" stop="20250625090000 +0000"><title>What Shapes Us</title><desc>Ian Walsh stops in and shares his thoughts with Selema on this episode of What Shapes Us.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000005" start="20250625090000 +0000" stop="20250625100000 +0000"><title>Descending</title><desc>In Indonesia, Scott and Ellis experience Raja Ampat – a reserve rich in beauty, diversity and culture.

The pub is run by landlord Brian who, after thirty years in the business and a quadruple heart-bypass, still puts in 120 hours a week and insists on laying down the law in the kitchen. Despite their best endeavours Brian and his partner Elaine are ~£250k in debt, losing ~1500 a week and facing bankruptcy within three months unless there's a drastic reversal in their fortunes.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250624210400 +0000" stop="20250624220400 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>In tonight's programme Gordon finds a chef caught in a time warp when he tackles a picturesque but largely unfrequented upmarket restaurant in King's Lynn, a traditional market town on the Norfolk coast. For the last eighteen months ex Michelin-starred chef Nick has owned and run Rococo but his past success is now eluding him. The menu is past its sell-by date, the service is stuffy, the food is over-priced and the only thing being fed is his ego. Yet, despite debts of ~£100k and the prospect of putting his home at risk and his young family on the streets, Nick continues to cook comatose in a 1990s fantasy land of his own making.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250624220400 +0000" stop="20250624225600 +0000"><title>Hotel Hell</title><desc>Gordon visits West Dover in Vermont, to try to save a dog-friendly hotel that’s desperately in need of help.
