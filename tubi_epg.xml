The trash talk is as fierce as the competition and continues to the Wipeout Zone with the winner taking not only the $20,000 but also the glory. Australia is also introduced to a new kind of “violent love”, the Fight Hug.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20251230073002 +0000" stop="20251230082519 +0000"><title>Wipeout Australia</title><desc>This week contestants on Wipeout Australia are bought undone by a seemingly simple obstacle on the Qualifier, the Slippery Stairs. It’s all in the name really, an innocent set of stairs, covered in Wipeout Crash cream. Its up the way and down the way for all and sundry. The lucky 12 that move through, battle it out with a giant toothbrush Sweeper. ‘Nat with the Tats’ and Renee ‘Lets get physical’ move through to the Dreadmill, flying the banner for the ladies. Look out for Scotty Six Toes at the Big Balls and get the ear plugs ready as you meet Herr Chris. It’s a colourful week with leotards, laughs and lots of ladies.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20251230082519 +0000" stop="20251230091811 +0000"><title>Wipeout Australia</title><desc>It’s Sitcom Central on Wipeout Australia with the Odd Couple, starring World’s Strongest Dwarf, David Clarke and Gentle Giant, Tim Watts.
