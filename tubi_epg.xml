This time, we’re in Grant, Florida, where 4 million clams are being released into the Indian River Lagoon, paired with the planting of thousands of mangroves, oyster work by CCA and trash clean ups to help restore one of Florida’s most critical ecosystems. But it’s not just about hard work—it’s about connection. With local captains, fishing legends, and the Local Knowledge crew on hand, we hit the water to show why this place is worth fighting for. From clam drops by drone, to in-water mangrove planting, to monster snook catches, this is hands-on conservation at its best. This two-part series kicks off with action, heart, and the kind of hope only a healthy waterway can bring.

From clam drops by drone, to in-water mangrove planting, to monster snook catches, this is hands-on conservation at its best.

Authorities arrested her captors, but they refused to reveal her whereabouts. The FBI and local police raced against time, determined to save the teenager's life. Their investigation revealed a complex story of drugs, betrayal and revenge.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000091" start="20251216192300 +0000" stop="20251216202400 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>By December 1985, John Gotti had assumed his place as the new Don of the Gambino crime family in New York with the assassination of his boss, Paul Castellano.  The Teflon Don felt secure in his position, always remaining one step ahead of the law.  But he was also the ongoing obsession of Bruce Mouw, leader of an elite crew of FBI agents formed to bring down the Gambino family.  With the help and genius of his Special Projects Squad, bugs were planted in Gotti's most private meeting places.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000091" start="20251216202400 +0000" stop="20251216212000 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>In 1992, a young mother was gunned down in front of her children.  Police searched for answers, but found none. The horrible crime appeared unmotivated, senseless, and random. Then, family members offered a startling clue.  The victim, the wife of a prominent Atlanta attorney, was also a woman burdened with a secret; a secret the FBI believed led to her death.  It would force local and federal agents to untangle an intricate web of money, drugs and murder.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000091" start="20251216212000 +0000" stop="20251216221900 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>A Labor Day weekend turned into a nightmare of murder as a cross-country crime spree terrorized the nation.  In a small Ohio community, an elderly woman and a teenage boy disappeared within hours of each other.  Police believed the cases were linked, but didn't know how. They contacted the FBI for help.  A trail of stolen vehicles and murder victims across seven states led agents on a hunt for two suspected killers. Their only hope of stopping them was to anticipate the killers' next move.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000091" start="20251216221900 +0000" stop="20251216231500 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>In 1997, a series of crimes in a small Iowa farming community left residents reeling in shock and fear. Two young men went on a crime spree of robbery, kidnapping and murder, and then disappeared. By the time they were identified, they already had a twelve-hour lead. As the hunt for the two men expanded, the FBI committed its resources to tracking down the suspects. The pursuit would take agents across six states to catch the killers before they struck again.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000091" start="20251216231500 +0000" stop="20251217001100 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>Racial tensions in Buffalo in 1980 were at an all-time high.  Six black males had been brutally murdered--two had their hearts cut out.  The only thing connecting the victims was their ethnicity and the fact that each had been shot with .22 caliber bullets. Residents screamed for the police to stop this serial killer.  With no suspects, local investigators turned to the FBI.  Profilers were able to produce a psychological composite of the type of person the killer would most likely be.  Their analysis paid off.</desc></programme><channel id="692086"><display-name>FilmRise True Crime</display-name><icon
