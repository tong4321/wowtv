First up is Mayfair, with a prime location on the busy seafront in Fuengirola, Costa del Sol. The restaurant was set up 28 years ago by 68 year old Londoner Pat and her husband of 45 years, Jack. The good news is that Fuengirola is one of the only towns in Spain that has actually seen an increase in tourists since the recession with 1 and half million Brits visiting last year alone;  the bad news is that Mayfair isn't benefitting. With thousands of hungry sun seekers right on its doorstep, the restaurant should be raking it in - but the place is totally empty.</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20251018230000 +0000" stop="20251019000000 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>World-renowned chef Gordon Ramsay explores new territory in Ramsay's Costa del Nightmares, a four part series that sees him travel to Europe's holiday hotspots. Episode two sees Gordon tackle struggling Le Deck restaurant in Capbreton, a popular coastal town in South West France.  British owners Tim and Debbie emigrated to France 28 years ago, where they met as holiday reps.  Since then they've poured blood, sweat and tears into opening  3 ski restaurants in the Alps.  With the arrival of their children, they set up home by the coast to enjoy the summer months together as a family.  But unable to sit still, Tim launched Le Deck three years ago.

First up is Mayfair, with a prime location on the busy seafront in Fuengirola, Costa del Sol. The restaurant was set up 28 years ago by 68 year old Londoner Pat and her husband of 45 years, Jack. The good news is that Fuengirola is one of the only towns in Spain that has actually seen an increase in tourists since the recession with 1 and half million Brits visiting last year alone;  the bad news is that Mayfair isn't benefitting. With thousands of hungry sun seekers right on its doorstep, the restaurant should be raking it in - but the place is totally empty.</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20251019070000 +0000" stop="20251019080000 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>World-renowned chef Gordon Ramsay explores new territory in Ramsay's Costa del Nightmares, a four part series that sees him travel to Europe's holiday hotspots.

We’ll be staying at Wildwood Resort, hitting the water with Captain Matt Loetscher of Living The Dream Guide Service, and capping off the day with spectacular lake views from their breezy lakeside bar.Hook, line, and sinker — you don’t want to miss this one!Ready to go catchin’ with one of Louisiana’s best captains?
