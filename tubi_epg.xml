on Wipeout Australia are bought undone by a seemingly simple obstacle on the Qualifier, the Slippery Stairs. It’s all in the name really, an innocent set of stairs, covered in Wipeout Crash cream. Its up the way and down the way for all and sundry. The lucky 12 that move through, battle it out with a giant toothbrush Sweeper. ‘Nat with the Tats’ and Renee ‘Lets get physical’ move through to the Dreadmill, flying the banner for the ladies. Look out for Scotty Six Toes at the Big Balls and get the ear plugs ready as you meet Herr Chris.

Each team will prepare a two-course menu for a VIP lunch, including a seared red snapper appetizer and a roasted venison loin entrée. Later in the MASTERCHEF kitchen, the judges will reveal which team received the best overall feedback on their dishes and had the most successful lunch service and which contestants will be in jeopardy of elimination. Then, it’s up to the judges to decide who will go home and who will continue in the competition and compete in the semi-finals.</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20250808040000 +0000" stop="20250808050000 +0000"><title>Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>Chef Ramsay visits Anna Vincenzo's, a family-run eatery in Boca Raton, Florida.

As a result, Yami Marik becomes angered, and attacks Odion with the Millennium Rod, which weakens Odion even more. Odion doesn't give up, despite Ishizu's protests. As Marik continues his onslaught (which begins to injure Odion), Odion tells Marik's good side that together, they had conquered his evil half before, and that they could do it again. Then, he tells the good Marik that since Yami Marik was created by the good Marik's hatred, he has the power to destroy him. As Yami Marik raises the Rod to deliver the final blow, the good Marik disappears from the field, and begins fighting against Yami Marik, who struggles for control over Marik's body, and refuses to be defeated. However, Marik's good half stalls Yami Marik long enough for Yugi to activate his spell card.
