Volunteers were divided into teams and sent to six different sites along the river to collect insect nymphs and larvae—tiny but mighty indicators of water health.Over 223 specimens were gathered, from stoneflies and mayflies to dragonfly larvae. These macroinvertebrates are highly sensitive to their environment, and their presence (or absence) can tell us a lot about the state of the river.The results? Based on initial identifications, the Cedar River shows signs of excellent water quality—making it one of Michigan’s prized Blue Ribbon Trout Streams.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20260106035524 +0000" stop="20260106040004 +0000"><title>Rivers are Life</title><desc>Why do Rivers are Life impact projects matter?

Led by Cory Redwine, Conservation Director of Project SeaSafe, this is the 4th Annual Clean Water Collective and it’s bigger than ever. This time, we’re in Grant, Florida, where 4 million clams are being released into the Indian River Lagoon, paired with the planting of thousands of mangroves, oyster work by CCA and trash clean ups to help restore one of Florida’s most critical ecosystems. But it’s not just about hard work—it’s about connection. With local captains, fishing legends, and the Local Knowledge crew on hand, we hit the water to show why this place is worth fighting for. From clam drops by drone, to in-water mangrove planting, to monster snook catches, this is hands-on conservation at its best. This two-part series kicks off with action, heart, and the kind of hope only a healthy waterway can bring. Don’t miss Part 1—where conservation meets community and everyone gets their hands wet.</desc></programme><channel id="400000000"><display-name>Waypoint TV</display-name><icon src="https://canvas-lb.tubitv.com/opts/j5_965C-CDR-0w==/4b2bb660-9424-45c9-ad67-9c7099f60cbf/CHgQeDoFMS4xLjhAAQ==" /></channel><programme channel="400000000" start="20260105163001 +0000" stop="20260105170001 +0000"><title>The Cast</title><desc>The Southards are heads to Table Rock for the annual family vacation.

Volunteers were divided into teams and sent to six different sites along the river to collect insect nymphs and larvae—tiny but mighty indicators of water health.Over 223 specimens were gathered, from stoneflies and mayflies to dragonfly larvae. These macroinvertebrates are highly sensitive to their environment, and their presence (or absence) can tell us a lot about the state of the river.The results?

Led by Cory Redwine, Conservation Director of Project SeaSafe, this is the 4th Annual Clean Water Collective and it’s bigger than ever. This time, we’re in Grant, Florida, where 4 million clams are being released into the Indian River Lagoon, paired with the planting of thousands of mangroves, oyster work by CCA and trash clean ups to help restore one of Florida’s most critical ecosystems. But it’s not just about hard work—it’s about connection. With local captains, fishing legends, and the Local Knowledge crew on hand, we hit the water to show why this place is worth fighting for. From clam drops by drone, to in-water mangrove planting, to monster snook catches, this is hands-on conservation at its best. This two-part series kicks off with action, heart, and the kind of hope only a healthy waterway can bring. Don’t miss Part 1—where conservation meets community and everyone gets their hands wet.</desc></programme><channel id="400000065"><display-name>Top Gear</display-name><icon src="https://canvas-lb.tubitv.com/opts/g_SN11NtWr_adw==/45d06aa3-8a80-4864-a7b0-25a606d26be3/CHgQeDoFMS4xLjhAAQ==" /></channel><programme channel="400000065" start="20260105153535 +0000" stop="20260105163605 +0000"><title>Top Gear UK</title><desc>Jeremy Clarkson casts his critical gaze over the Nissan Cube.
