In a small Ohio community, an elderly woman and a teenage boy disappeared within hours of each other.  Police believed the cases were linked, but didn't know how. They contacted the FBI for help.  A trail of stolen vehicles and murder victims across seven states led agents on a hunt for two suspected killers.

With no experience with this kind of predator, Viennese police turned to the FBI. FBI profilers were able to identify a suspect in the murders.  More ominously, they linked this same killer to murders committed in the United States.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000091" start="20251005065200 +0000" stop="20251005074800 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>Racial tensions in Buffalo in 1980 were at an all-time high.
