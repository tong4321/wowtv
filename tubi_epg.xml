Midsomer Florey, when she discovers the body of an elderly fellow student, Ruth Fairfax, concealed beneath some undergrowth shortly after a session.

While Troy is allowed to assist them, Barnaby is left handling a local operation into a spate of thefts, yet he decides to continue his investigations in secret. In doing so, he soon turns up armed robbery, unaccounted stolen money, former criminals, and secret liaisons, before discovering that the NIS investigation is not being as thorough as it should be.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20251224101200 +0000" stop="20251224121000 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>At his family home in Upper Warden, arrogant actor Larry Smith is killed, when a summer house he walks in to as part of a promotion for the sequel to his hit film, The House of Satan, is suddenly destroyed in an explosion.

Anne Merrick tells them about Winyard, a tumbledown cottage in the woods, might be for sale. At the estate agents they are told the house is not yet available for viewing. Later that evening they find the house on their own. However, Caroline has read up on the cottage's haunted reputation and only reluctantly explores it with Peter. The next morning they are found strangled in their own car. DCI Barnaby starts the investigation with the help of PC Ben Jones and they come across the world of estate agents, identical twins, ghosts, piano wire, and more before another body turns up.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20251225202400 +0000" stop="20251225221700 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>Villagers of Midsomer Barton are all set to celebrate Oak Apple Week, especially as the carnival queen event is set to return after an eight year absence.
