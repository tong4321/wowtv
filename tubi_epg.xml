First up is Mayfair, with a prime location on the busy seafront in Fuengirola, Costa del Sol. The restaurant was set up 28 years ago by 68 year old Londoner Pat and her husband of 45 years, Jack. The good news is that Fuengirola is one of the only towns in Spain that has actually seen an increase in tourists since the recession with 1 and half million Brits visiting last year alone;  the bad news is that Mayfair isn't benefitting. With thousands of hungry sun seekers right on its doorstep, the restaurant should be raking it in - but the place is totally empty.</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20250719170000 +0000" stop="20250719180000 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>World-renowned chef Gordon Ramsay explores new territory in Ramsay's Costa del Nightmares, a four part series that sees him travel to Europe's holiday hotspots. Episode two sees Gordon tackle struggling Le Deck restaurant in Capbreton, a popular coastal town in South West France.  British owners Tim and Debbie emigrated to France 28 years ago, where they met as holiday reps.  Since then they've poured blood, sweat and tears into opening  3 ski restaurants in the Alps.  With the arrival of their children, they set up home by the coast to enjoy the summer months together as a family.  But unable to sit still, Tim launched Le Deck three years ago.  Far from being a hobby, the restaurant has taken over his life.</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20250719180000 +0000" stop="20250719190000 +0000"><title>The F Word</title><desc>S03:E03 - The F Word</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20250719190000 +0000" stop="20250719200000 +0000"><title>The F Word</title><desc>S03:E04 - The F Word</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20250719200000 +0000" stop="20250719210000 +0000"><title>Gordon's Great Escape</title><desc>S01:E01 - Episode 1</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20250719210000 +0000" stop="20250719220000 +0000"><title>Gordon's Great Escape</title><desc>S01:E02 - Episode 2</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20250719220000 +0000" stop="20250719230000 +0000"><title>The F Word</title><desc>S03:E05 - The F Word</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20250719230000 +0000" stop="20250720000000 +0000"><title>The F Word</title><desc>S03:E06 - The F Word</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20250720000000 +0000" stop="20250720010000 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>World-renowned chef Gordon Ramsay explores new territory in Ramsay's Costa del Nightmares, a four part series that sees him travel to Europe's holiday hotspots.

Justin Leake and his cousin encounter when December turns unseasonably warm. It’s a grey morning with thick fog so Justin and Capt. Brent Berry won’t be heading offshore right away as planned. Instead, Justin turns to his Humminbird CoastMaster charts to pinpoint a near shore artificial reef just five minutes from the St. Andrews Pass, where the anglers will do a little fishing until the fog burns off. Capt. Leake opts to send a jig to the bottom and he’s not very picky about the one that gets tied on. “When fishing reefs, the specific jig doesn’t matter because it’s all about the presentation,” he says. “When you’re sitting on top of a wreck, break out the ‘junk jigs’ – they get bit just fine.” And that proves to be the case as Justin and Brent enjoy non-stop battles against amberjack, red snapper and bonita. And with a bite this good, there’s no reason to go anywhere else! Also, we take a look at the United States Coast Guard Auxiliary’s new paddle craft safety initiative.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20250720150000 +0000" stop="20250720151615 +0000"><title>The Raven Project</title><desc>The boys are still at the Dirty bird in Oklahoma, trying to get a few more tasks done before heading back to the Raven in Missouri.

Justin Leake and his cousin encounter when December turns unseasonably warm. It’s a grey morning with thick fog so Justin and Capt. Brent Berry won’t be heading offshore right away as planned. Instead, Justin turns to his Humminbird CoastMaster charts to pinpoint a near shore artificial reef just five minutes from the St. Andrews Pass, where the anglers will do a little fishing until the fog burns off. Capt. Leake opts to send a jig to the bottom and he’s not very picky about the one that gets tied on. “When fishing reefs, the specific jig doesn’t matter because it’s all about the presentation,” he says. “When you’re sitting on top of a wreck, break out the ‘junk jigs’ – they get bit just fine.” And that proves to be the case as Justin and Brent enjoy non-stop battles against amberjack, red snapper and bonita. And with a bite this good, there’s no reason to go anywhere else!
