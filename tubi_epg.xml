The project supports sturgeon population recovery through egg collection, hatchery programs, and community events like Port Huron’s Sturgeon Fest, organized by the Friends of the St. Clair River. Every year since its inception in 2012, Sturgeon Fest has released young sturgeon back into the wild, contributing to the unique species' resurgence in the Great Lakes region. This year, the Rivers are Life team helped tag two juvenile sturgeons, which made their debut in the popular festival's touch tank before release.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20251213000006 +0000" stop="20251213003001 +0000"><title>Local Lines</title><desc>Capt Brandon visits Quails Landing Plantation in South Georgia and his buddy Steven Redrick to do all things outdoors.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20251213003001 +0000" stop="20251213010000 +0000"><title>The Direction</title><desc>Lake Okeechobee comes to mind when you think of Florida bass fishing, and for good reason.
