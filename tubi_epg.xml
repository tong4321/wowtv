Second only to Alaska in size, Texas is known as the place where everything is bigger. From big college football games to endless oil fields and vast wind farms, Texas is home to more than 30 million Americans. But the state is about more than just big oil, college football and cattle farms - it's also home to some of the best boating in the country. Boasting a myriad of waterways, boaters here enjoy hundreds of lakes, rivers and streams that provide recreational opportunities, abundant wildlife and plenty of fishing. From Austin Texas to San Antonio host Ryan McVinney and the Boat Trader crew explore the laid-back Texas lake life including boat up restaurants along the Colorado River, watersports in Austin and the history of the waterways throughout the region. Boat manufacturers highlighted in this episode are Tige Boats and ATX Surf Boats, two premium Texas-based wake boat brands known for their high-quality, cutting-edge vessels that come equipped with advanced wake shaping technologies and equipment ideal for water skiing, wake surfing and wakeboarding.

Second only to Alaska in size, Texas is known as the place where everything is bigger. From big college football games to endless oil fields and vast wind farms, Texas is home to more than 30 million Americans. But the state is about more than just big oil, college football and cattle farms - it's also home to some of the best boating in the country.

When another death occurs, the detectives learn that there are plenty of dark secrets and fierce hostilities in this apparently idyllic village. Will Jack Purdy's quick temper lead to violence? How far would the protesters go to prevent the bypass being built? And do current events somehow relate to the death of Michael Wilson many years earlier?</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20251127130000 +0000" stop="20251127150000 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>When the body of Londoner Charlie Finleyson is discovered in woodland near Midsomer Sonning, Barnaby and Jones find themselves investigating employees at local Midsomer Life magazine. It turns out the dead man was married to the ex-wife of Guy Sandys, the wealthy owner of the publication. As the detectives become aware of a feud between Guy and the proprietor of the Morecroft Hotel, tensions are also heating up between the locals and visiting Londoners.

Barnaby and Jones discover that the victim was poisoned with a rare toxin extracted from Ecuadorean poison frogs - so the hunt is on for a particularly ruthless and imaginative killer. The detectives soon learn that a feud is raging between local occult practitioner Ernest Balliol and famous writer Aloysius Wilmington. While some of the villagers - such as Ernest's daughter Isolde - believe that powerful magical forces are at play, others think the reasons for the bloodshed may have their roots in the distant past. Barnaby and Jones soon find themselves delving into the occult, magic, and ancients books of power, to determine what happened, and soon sense a mixture of both might be the motive for the murder, when a book shop owner is killed with shattered glass, laced in the same poison.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20251127170000 +0000" stop="20251127190000 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>Barnaby and Jones are forced to take part in a team building exercise and Tom has plenty of problems dealing with the young, new, acting Chief Superintendent, John Cotton (Nick Fletcher). Following an explosion in a truck that had been stored in a truck depot, a body is soon discovered in a nearby lake, which turns out to be Alec Grainger, who had been seen arguing with James Parkes (Joseph Millson), the son of Colonel Matt Parkes (Tim Pigott-Smith). James appears to be involved in shady business deals and is blamed by his grandmother Caroline Halsey (Judy Parfitt) - and others - for the suicide of a woman he got pregnant two years before. Barnaby and Jones find themselves delving into a mixture of fraud, smuggling, and lies, trying to piece together the truth.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20251127190000 +0000" stop="20251127200000 +0000"><title>Leverage: Redemption</title><desc>The team goes undercover on an oil rig to find dirt on a crooked CEO who is covering up oil spills.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20251127200000 +0000" stop="20251127210000 +0000"><title>Leverage: Redemption</title><desc>The team sneaks into R.I.Z. to stop them from destroying the electrical grid, but they need Harry's help.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20251127210000 +0000" stop="20251127220000 +0000"><title>Leverage</title><desc>A desperate aerospace CEO asks Nate Ford - an insurance investigator who once specialized in recovering stolen goods worth millions - to lead a team of expert thieves to recover airplane designs from the rival company that took them.
