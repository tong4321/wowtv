Various scenarios are created that force people to make split-second -- and often surprising -- decisions, and variations of the situation (such as changing the genders, races or clothing of the people involved) are often featured to see if different reactions are elicited. Examples of situations on the show include a waitress being harassed by her boss, and a drunken valet trying to park cars.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20251123090000 +0000" stop="20251123110000 +0000"><title>20/20</title><desc>Award-winning program anchored by David Muir, featuring unforgettable, character-driven true crime mysteries, exclusive newsmaker interviews, hard-hitting investigative reports and in-depth coverage of high profile stories.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20251123110000 +0000" stop="20251123113000 +0000"><title>ABC News Live Weekend</title><desc>Breaking news coverage and live video.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20251123113000 +0000" stop="20251123120000 +0000"><title>GMA Life</title><desc>A weekly roundup of the best lifestyle content from "Good Morning America";

Tim Gray was the 21 year-old Head Chef at Bonaparte's in Silsden, West Yorkshire. Claiming to specialise in "fine dining", he had ambitions to be a TV chef and dreamed of opening restaurants in London, Paris and New York. Unfortunately, Tim couldn't even cook an omelette and his trademark scallops made Ramsay throw up. A true kitchen nightmare if ever there was one.

With no customers and a fridge full of fancy ingredients, Bonaparte's was losing money fast. Ramsay soon established that what the people of Silsden really want to eat is Beef and Ale Pie and Treacle Tart. Ramsay soon had the restaurant chocker block but what state is it in now?</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20251123100000 +0000" stop="20251123110000 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>Saturday night at The Glass House Restaurant in Ambleside was a disaster.  Orders in the kitchen were mixed up, the food wasn't cooked properly and the customers were complaining.  Not only was the chef in tears, but the owners were on the brink of bankruptcy.   

A few months on, there have been some departures from the Glass House. Who is in charge of the kitchen now? And, more importantly, is Ramsay's Caesar salad still on the menu?</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20251123110000 +0000" stop="20251123120000 +0000"><title>The F Word</title><desc>S02:E07 - Episode 7</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20251123120000 +0000" stop="20251123130000 +0000"><title>The F Word</title><desc>S02:E08 - Episode 8</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20251123130000 +0000" stop="20251123140000 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Best Restaurant</title><desc>S01:E08 - Spanish</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20251123140000 +0000" stop="20251123150000 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Best Restaurant</title><desc>S01:E09 - Semi Final 1</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20251123150000 +0000" stop="20251123160000 +0000"><title>The F Word</title><desc>S02:E09 - Episode 9</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20251123160000 +0000" stop="20251123170000 +0000"><title>The F Word</title><desc>S03:E02 - The F Word</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20251123170000 +0000" stop="20251123180000 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20251123180000 +0000" stop="20251123190000 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>Nick and Richard are self-confessed restaurant virgins.  They've both had successful careers in the brewery business so when they bought Moore Place they believed they could make it an instant success.

Led by Cory Redwine, Conservation Director of Project SeaSafe, this is the 4th Annual Clean Water Collective and it’s bigger than ever. This time, we’re in Grant, Florida, where 4 million clams are being released into the Indian River Lagoon, paired with the planting of thousands of mangroves, oyster work by CCA and trash clean ups to help restore one of Florida’s most critical ecosystems. But it’s not just about hard work—it’s about connection. With local captains, fishing legends, and the Local Knowledge crew on hand, we hit the water to show why this place is worth fighting for. From clam drops by drone, to in-water mangrove planting, to monster snook catches, this is hands-on conservation at its best. This two-part series kicks off with action, heart, and the kind of hope only a healthy waterway can bring. Don’t miss Part 1—where conservation meets community and everyone gets their hands wet.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20251124023109 +0000" stop="20251124030105 +0000"><title>Local Knowledge</title><desc>As part of this year's Star brite Sea Safe event, we hit the water to experience some of the incredible fishing the Indian River Lagoon has to offer.

Led by Cory Redwine, Conservation Director of Project SeaSafe, this is the 4th Annual Clean Water Collective and it’s bigger than ever. This time, we’re in Grant, Florida, where 4 million clams are being released into the Indian River Lagoon, paired with the planting of thousands of mangroves, oyster work by CCA and trash clean ups to help restore one of Florida’s most critical ecosystems. But it’s not just about hard work—it’s about connection. With local captains, fishing legends, and the Local Knowledge crew on hand, we hit the water to show why this place is worth fighting for. From clam drops by drone, to in-water mangrove planting, to monster snook catches, this is hands-on conservation at its best. This two-part series kicks off with action, heart, and the kind of hope only a healthy waterway can bring. Don’t miss Part 1—where conservation meets community and everyone gets their hands wet.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20251124023109 +0000" stop="20251124030105 +0000"><title>Local Knowledge</title><desc>As part of this year's Star brite Sea Safe event, we hit the water to experience some of the incredible fishing the Indian River Lagoon has to offer.

Just as Barnaby begins to learn that Ruth was not all she seemed to be, officers of the NIS pull him off the case. While Troy is allowed to assist them, Barnaby is left handling a local operation into a spate of thefts, yet he decides to continue his investigations in secret. In doing so, he soon turns up armed robbery, unaccounted stolen money, former criminals, and secret liaisons, before discovering that the NIS investigation is not being as thorough as it should be.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20251124083100 +0000" stop="20251124102900 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>At his family home in Upper Warden, arrogant actor Larry Smith is killed, when a summer house he walks in to as part of a promotion for the sequel to his hit film, The House of Satan, is suddenly destroyed in an explosion.

While there was evidence he was desperately seeking to avoid bankruptcy, and had visited a local millionaire to get back his money from a scheme he had invested in, a post mortem reveals that he had been murdered. The two detectives soon find their investigations crossing over, when a man found to have an illegal collection of bird eggs, is also murdered, prompting concerns that the millionaire's scheme is being used to defraud many, and that someone is willing to kill to keep the scheme going.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20251124122600 +0000" stop="20251124142600 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>Barnaby and Troy tackle two separate cases as Troy prepares to leave Midsomer after his promotion to DI.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20251124142600 +0000" stop="20251124162600 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>Barnaby's new Sergeant arrives on the day after the murder of a local shrew occurs, and he is immediately put to work.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20251124162600 +0000" stop="20251124182300 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>Long-suppressed family secrets, stolen ancient artefacts, and a thirty year old death at a Celtic burial site result in a series of murders in present day Midsomer.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20251124182300 +0000" stop="20251124201600 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>When Midsomer hosts its 12th Annual Literary Festival, an author is found with his neck broken.
