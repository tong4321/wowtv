Justin Leake and his cousin encounter when December turns unseasonably warm. It’s a grey morning with thick fog so Justin and Capt. Brent Berry won’t be heading offshore right away as planned. Instead, Justin turns to his Humminbird CoastMaster charts to pinpoint a near shore artificial reef just five minutes from the St. Andrews Pass, where the anglers will do a little fishing until the fog burns off. Capt. Leake opts to send a jig to the bottom and he’s not very picky about the one that gets tied on. “When fishing reefs, the specific jig doesn’t matter because it’s all about the presentation,” he says. “When you’re sitting on top of a wreck, break out the ‘junk jigs’ – they get bit just fine.” And that proves to be the case as Justin and Brent enjoy non-stop battles against amberjack, red snapper and bonita. And with a bite this good, there’s no reason to go anywhere else!

Justin Leake and his cousin encounter when December turns unseasonably warm. It’s a grey morning with thick fog so Justin and Capt. Brent Berry won’t be heading offshore right away as planned. Instead, Justin turns to his Humminbird CoastMaster charts to pinpoint a near shore artificial reef just five minutes from the St. Andrews Pass, where the anglers will do a little fishing until the fog burns off. Capt. Leake opts to send a jig to the bottom and he’s not very picky about the one that gets tied on. “When fishing reefs, the specific jig doesn’t matter because it’s all about the presentation,” he says. “When you’re sitting on top of a wreck, break out the ‘junk jigs’ – they get bit just fine.” And that proves to be the case as Justin and Brent enjoy non-stop battles against amberjack, red snapper and bonita. And with a bite this good, there’s no reason to go anywhere else! Also, we take a look at the United States Coast Guard Auxiliary’s new paddle craft safety initiative.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20250729120001 +0000" stop="20250729121617 +0000"><title>The Raven Project</title><desc>Join in as Randy and Cody are hard at work on the Raven Planting some Big Tine borderline on one of their favorite plots on the farm.

As plans to shut the Midsomer Magna factory are being put into action, Alan's wife Hilary and brother Charles are married in the village church - much to the dismay of Alan's son Ian. In addition to strife between members of the family, the factory workers are outraged at the loss of their jobs. So when company accountant Peter Baxter is found murdered, Barnaby and Jones suspect a disgruntled employee is to blame.

Barnaby himself is particularly looking forward to seeing recently re-formed rock band, Hired Gun, perform on stage, but he soon gets close to the band for rather unfortunate reasons. During their opening performance, the band's singer, Mimi (Suzi Quatro), falls to the ground dead - electrocuted by a wire that had been run through the microphone stand. Barnaby and Jones soon find the rest of the band could be targets, and when another is killed, questions are raised as to whether former band member, Ginger Foxton, who went missing for 30 years and is presumed dead, is still at large. The detectives soon have to delve into a world of rock music, drug use and greed, to find the truth.</desc></programme><programme channel="684167" start="20250729100000 +0000" stop="20250729110000 +0000"><title>CSI: Miami</title><desc>The team suspects that a nerd is responsible for stoning to death a high-school bully.</desc></programme><programme channel="684167" start="20250729110000 +0000" stop="20250729120000 +0000"><title>CSI: Miami</title><desc>After a woman barely escapes death at the hands of a serial killer, Horatio intends to catch the criminal.</desc></programme><programme channel="684167" start="20250729120000 +0000" stop="20250729130000 +0000"><title>CSI: Miami</title><desc>The team discovers a club where hunters pursue human prey deep in the Everglades.</desc></programme><programme channel="684167" start="20250729130000 +0000" stop="20250729140000 +0000"><title>CSI: Miami</title><desc>The team tries to find a connection between the murders of a truck driver and a woman on his delivery route.</desc></programme><programme channel="684167" start="20250729140000 +0000" stop="20250729150000 +0000"><title>CSI: Miami</title><desc>An escaped prisoner takes Natalia hostage and reveals shocking secrets about his crimes.</desc></programme><programme channel="684167" start="20250729150000 +0000" stop="20250729160000 +0000"><title>CSI: Miami</title><desc>Horatio must protect a mixed-martial-arts fighter from the guy's brother, a prison escapee.</desc></programme><programme channel="684167" start="20250729160000 +0000" stop="20250729170000 +0000"><title>CSI: Miami</title><desc>The CSIs investigate the death of a college student whose body was found in a hot tub.</desc></programme><programme channel="684167" start="20250729170000 +0000" stop="20250729180000 +0000"><title>CSI: Miami</title><desc>When Horatio tracks down a mysterious murder suspect, he discovers the man's life is a charade.</desc></programme><programme channel="684167" start="20250729180000 +0000" stop="20250729190000 +0000"><title>CSI: Miami</title><desc>When the transport plane carrying a fugitive crash-lands, the CSIs learn the criminal is planning more than just an escape.</desc></programme><programme channel="684167" start="20250729190000 +0000" stop="20250729200000 +0000"><title>CSI: Miami</title><desc>As Natalia and Horatio's lives hang in the balance, the team tries to catch an escaped killer.</desc></programme><programme channel="684167" start="20250729200000 +0000" stop="20250729210000 +0000"><title>CSI: Miami</title><desc>The discovery of a strange murder weapon leads the CSIs into the world of gigolos.</desc></programme><programme channel="684167" start="20250729210000 +0000" stop="20250729220000 +0000"><title>CSI: Miami</title><desc>Evidence is damaged and Ryan and Walter are put in danger when a tornado tears through a murder scene.</desc></programme><programme channel="684167" start="20250729220000 +0000" stop="20250729230000 +0000"><title>CSI: Miami</title><desc>The team pursues a killer who takes the eyes from victims; a new adversary challenges Horatio.</desc></programme><programme channel="684167" start="20250729230000 +0000" stop="20250730000000 +0000"><title>CSI: Miami</title><desc>Horatio must protect a Mexican police chief from the unknown assassin responsible for her husband's death.</desc></programme><channel id="700415"><display-name>Midsomer Murders</display-name><icon src="https://canvas-lb.tubitv.com/opts/oiGkMUJHBMVcLA==/34fa2e5d-6c68-4012-8c19-cc4afe6ad726/CHgQeDoFMS4xLjdAAQ==" /></channel><programme channel="700415" start="20250728044700 +0000" stop="20250728063400 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>The suspicious death of popular young GP Dr Alan Delaney brings Barnaby and Jones to Midsomer Market to investigate. The detectives are baffled as to a motive for murder - until they consider that the newly engaged Dr James Kirkwood may have been the intended victim. Before long, Barnaby and Jones are heading to Wales - former home to Delyth Mostyn, James's fiancee, to delve deeper into the mystery. There are certainly possible suspects in the murder and attempt on Kirkwood, from Delyth's children, who oppose the engagement, Delyth's husband, and more, as the detectives investigate things, in hopes of uncovering the truth before a major walk is to take place on Mount Snowdon.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20250728063400 +0000" stop="20250728082300 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>In the build-up to Luxton Deeping's annual photographic exhibition, a battle rages between the traditional and digital photographers of the pretty village. The dispute seems harmless enough - until Lionel Bell is found murdered in a nearby woodland, strangled with the cord of his light meter. Barnaby soon gets to work tracking down the killer, but it seems someone is trying to implicate the detective in the murder. And once he is replaced on the case, finding the culprit seems less likely than ever, as his replacement is more concerned of an upcoming wedding than the investigation. Barnaby is forced to work off the case to uncover who is framing him, and who wants dead other photographers in the village.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20250728082300 +0000" stop="20250728101000 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>The residents of Midsomer Magna are thrilled when a production crew arrives at the local manor house to film a version of The Scarlet Pimpernel.

When Jack is murdered, the detective must delve into the dark secrets in the victim's past. There are certainly dark secrets to uncover, and Barnaby has to determine whether the victim's part in a scandal years earlier at Causton police station, is key to the mystery behind his death. It isn't long before he finds that Eddie Marston is attempting blackmail, and soon murdered as a result, and that Lord Holm is in love with Jack's wife, psychotherapist Gina.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20250728115900 +0000" stop="20250728134500 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>The ghost village of Little Auburn has been abandoned since the war.
