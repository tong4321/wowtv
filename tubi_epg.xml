Things become even more complex when Rex's body is found in a nearby river, bearing wounds that suggest he was murdered. Barnaby and Jones are soon on the case, trying to establish who would have wanted the elderly man dead. Several people soon come forward with multiple wills, which confuse the matter, but when two more people, close friends of Rex, are also murdered, the investigation raises question on the motive, leading Barnaby to wonder if it was down to finances, passion, or something from Rex's past.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20250831100000 +0000" stop="20250831110000 +0000"><title>Murdoch Mysteries</title><desc>Murdoch investigates a man's murder outside a burlesque show performed by Crabtree's former paramour Nina Bloom.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20250831110000 +0000" stop="20250831120000 +0000"><title>Murdoch Mysteries</title><desc>After a motorcycle enthusiast dies, Murdoch's investigation is aided by mechanics William Harley and Arthur Davidson.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20250831120000 +0000" stop="20250831130000 +0000"><title>Murdoch Mysteries</title><desc>While investigating a murder in a tight-lipped Mennonite colony, Murdoch and Ogden don plain clothing and go under cover.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20250831130000 +0000" stop="20250831140000 +0000"><title>Murdoch Mysteries</title><desc>Hours before a clandestine visit by President Taft, Murdoch is entangled by Terence Meyers in an experiment gone wrong.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20250831140000 +0000" stop="20250831150000 +0000"><title>Murdoch Mysteries</title><desc>Murdoch investigates the brutal on-camera murder of an actress during the filming of a movie about the clown killer.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20250831150000 +0000" stop="20250831160000 +0000"><title>Murdoch Mysteries</title><desc>Honeymooning in England, Crabtree and Effie find a dead hotel guest while Murdoch investigates an apparent suicide.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20250831160000 +0000" stop="20250831170000 +0000"><title>Murdoch Mysteries</title><desc>As Murdoch investigates the murder of an elite athlete who gets impaled by a javelin, Hart and Arthur plot her father's demise.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20250831170000 +0000" stop="20250831180000 +0000"><title>Murdoch Mysteries</title><desc>The sudden death of a key witness leaves Murdoch physically unsettled.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20250831180000 +0000" stop="20250831190000 +0000"><title>Murdoch Mysteries</title><desc>Higgins enlists Watts help after he messes up the courier delivery of a horse statue for some very dangerous thugs.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20250831190000 +0000" stop="20250831200000 +0000"><title>Murdoch Mysteries</title><desc>Murdoch must prove Brackenreid's innocence when he's framed for murder by a vengeful foe.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20250831200000 +0000" stop="20250831210000 +0000"><title>Magnum P.I.</title><desc>Katsumoto's hearing date has arrived, and he will learn if his career in law enforcement is over for good or not; Magnum and Higgins are hired to investigate a man their client believes committed murder; Rick's suspicions grow on their relationship.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20250831210000 +0000" stop="20250831220000 +0000"><title>Magnum P.I.</title><desc>Magnum and Higgins investigate the robbery of an elderly man suffering from Alzheimer's; the ohana tries to help TC overcome a past trauma.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20250831220000 +0000" stop="20250831230000 +0000"><title>Magnum P.I.</title><desc>Magnum and Rick make a shocking discovery in the Capt.

In addition to strife between members of the family, the factory workers are outraged at the loss of their jobs. So when company accountant Peter Baxter is found murdered, Barnaby and Jones suspect a disgruntled employee is to blame. But in order to investigate the matter further, Jones is forced to work undercover, and infiltrate the local group of Freemasons in the village.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20250901080000 +0000" stop="20250901100000 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>The music lovers of Midsomer County are delighted when a host of bands arrives for the Midsomer Rocks festival. Barnaby himself is particularly looking forward to seeing recently re-formed rock band, Hired Gun, perform on stage, but he soon gets close to the band for rather unfortunate reasons. During their opening performance, the band's singer, Mimi (Suzi Quatro), falls to the ground dead - electrocuted by a wire that had been run through the microphone stand. Barnaby and Jones soon find the rest of the band could be targets, and when another is killed, questions are raised as to whether former band member, Ginger Foxton, who went missing for 30 years and is presumed dead, is still at large. The detectives soon have to delve into a world of rock music, drug use and greed, to find the truth.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20250901100000 +0000" stop="20250901110000 +0000"><title>Private Eyes</title><desc>During her recovery from an injury, Angie hears someone threatened from her hospital room while under the influence of a drug;

Calverese comes up with a brilliant take-down scheme to nab everyone involved in the smuggling - a personal invitation to his fabricated wedding.
