Shortly before leaving their hotel they mention they haven't been able to find what they're looking for; "something old and derelict that they can do up." Anne Merrick tells them about Winyard, a tumbledown cottage in the woods, might be for sale. At the estate agents they are told the house is not yet available for viewing. Later that evening they find the house on their own. However, Caroline has read up on the cottage's haunted reputation and only reluctantly explores it with Peter. The next morning they are found strangled in their own car.

To make matters worse the credit crunch has hit and there is fierce competition from corporate chains.

With the advent of the credit crunch, soaring food prices, thrifty clientele and unrelenting competition from the high street chains, Gordon is determined to galvanise the owners, the staff and the local community to ensure their survival and keep customers coming back for more.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250701231000 +0000" stop="20250702001000 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers</title><desc>Jay saves Luke's bacon with a polished portrait; Sketch beautifies Mark's belly Buddha.</desc></programme><channel id="715948"><display-name>Family Unscripted</display-name><icon src="https://canvas-lb.tubitv.com/opts/VMNlSKleecHNvw==/6ea6276d-0cdb-4348-a68f-5b6cc575c8cb/CHgQeDoFMS4xLjdAAQ==" /></channel><programme channel="715948" start="20250630124114 +0000" stop="20250630130616 +0000"><title>Here Comes Honey Boo Boo</title><desc>Anna's rushed to the hospital, and June considers saying goodbye to Glitzy.</desc></programme><programme channel="715948" start="20250630130616 +0000" stop="20250630132849 +0000"><title>Here Comes Honey Boo Boo</title><desc>Alana gets a teacup pig named Glitzy, and June hires an etiquette expert.</desc></programme><programme channel="715948" start="20250630132849 +0000" stop="20250630135122 +0000"><title>Here Comes Honey Boo Boo</title><desc>June and the girls visit the spa.

An 11-year-old girl was missing.  Her parents were certain she was no runaway.  When they failed to find her in their quiet Illinois neighborhood, they called the police.  The FBI soon joined the investigation and family and friends worked with detectives and agents in an urgent search for the missing girl.  Faced with conflicting witness reports and false leads, agents wouldn't stop until they found the girl, and the truth.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000091" start="20250630134500 +0000" stop="20250630144100 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>In Arizona, a shipment of money vanished into the high desert, along with the two men hired to guard it.  The FBI didn't know if the guards were participants or victims of an ambush.  Answers lay somewhere in the thousands of square miles of Arizona's northwest territory.  When the vehicle was recovered with three hundred thousand dollars and the drivers missing, suspicions that the crime was an inside job grew.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000091" start="20250630144100 +0000" stop="20250630153900 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>Beginning in summer of 1990, the bodies of several women began turning up in and around the city of Vienna, Austria. From an extensive investigation by the Viennese police, it was determined that these murders were the work of one sadistic predator.  Europe was dealing with a serial killer.  With no experience with this kind of predator, Viennese police turned to the FBI. FBI profilers were able to identify a suspect in the murders.  More ominously, they linked this same killer to murders committed in the United States.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000091" start="20250630153900 +0000" stop="20250630163800 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>In 1992, a young mother was gunned down in front of her children.  Police searched for answers, but found none. The horrible crime appeared unmotivated, senseless, and random. Then, family members offered a startling clue.  The victim, the wife of a prominent Atlanta attorney, was also a woman burdened with a secret; a secret the FBI believed led to her death.  It would force local and federal agents to untangle an intricate web of money, drugs and murder.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000091" start="20250630163800 +0000" stop="20250630173500 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>In the early 1990's drug gangs terrorized Harlem, New York neighborhoods.
