Various scenarios are created that force people to make split-second -- and often surprising -- decisions, and variations of the situation (such as changing the genders, races or clothing of the people involved) are often featured to see if different reactions are elicited. Examples of situations on the show include a waitress being harassed by her boss, and a drunken valet trying to park cars.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20250907080000 +0000" stop="20250907100000 +0000"><title>20/20</title><desc>Award-winning program anchored by David Muir, featuring unforgettable, character-driven true crime mysteries, exclusive newsmaker interviews, hard-hitting investigative reports and in-depth coverage of high profile stories.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20250907100000 +0000" stop="20250907103000 +0000"><title>ABC News Live Weekend</title><desc>Breaking news coverage and live video.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20250907103000 +0000" stop="20250907110000 +0000"><title>GMA Life</title><desc>A weekly roundup of the best lifestyle content from "Good Morning America";

It delves into the spiritual relevance of todays day and age at even furher levels. A feature length film created to help inspire everyday people through real life parables and narrations from recognizable spiritual figureheads. Presented as a series of short vignettes recorded in an intimate, close-cropped setting to engage the viewer as if he or she is soul seeking wisdom at the foot of a sage. Weaving the journey and anecdotes of some of the most prolific high profile ministers, evangelists and church leaders of the 21st Century, The Scroll took three years to complete, interviewing over 50 of the U.S.'s most progressive and revered Spiritual Leaders.</desc></programme><programme channel="692087" start="20250908174700 +0000" stop="20250908193900 +0000"><title>Torn</title><desc>After discovering his wife is cheating on him, Delroy has to decide whether to pursue a promising new relationship, or fix his troubled marriage.</desc></programme><programme channel="692087" start="20250908193900 +0000" stop="20250908212300 +0000"><title>Klippers</title><desc>After a loan shark hires a hitman to kill his ex-wife in exchange for debt erasal, the job quickly becomes more complicated than anyone thought.</desc></programme><programme channel="692087" start="20250908212300 +0000" stop="20250908233200 +0000"><title>Love &amp; Drugs 2: The Sacrifice</title><desc>A man who believed his life was going in the right direction is faced with a decision to either betray the woman he loves or turn on his best friend.</desc></programme><programme channel="692087" start="20250908233200 +0000" stop="20250909010800 +0000"><title>The Love We Had</title><desc>After one decision destroys the life of a young couple, it continues to ruin their other relationships and everything they hold sacred.</desc></programme><channel id="400000004"><display-name>Revolt Mixtape</display-name><icon src="https://canvas-lb.tubitv.com/opts/4B20EMNDD-lyNA==/42481df4-a22f-4a86-90db-db1f96840422/CHgQeDoFMS4xLjhAAQ==" /></channel><programme channel="400000004" start="20250907010000 +0000" stop="20250907020000 +0000"><title>The Fat Joe Show</title><desc>NBA Champion Dwayne Wade joins Fat Joe to talk making music with Rick Ross and share what happened behind ...</desc></programme><programme channel="400000004" start="20250907020000 +0000" stop="20250907030000 +0000"><title>The Fat Joe Show</title><desc>Music mogul Jermaine Dupri talks to Fat Joe about his start in the music industry as a dancer, how he conn...</desc></programme><programme channel="400000004" start="20250907030000 +0000" stop="20250907040000 +0000"><title>The Fat Joe Show</title><desc>Big Sean joins Fat Joe to share his love for Detroit, how he was discovered by Kanye, and why he turned do...</desc></programme><programme channel="400000004" start="20250907040000 +0000" stop="20250907064500 +0000"><title>Drink Champs</title><desc>Queens legend MC Serch joins N.O.R.E. and DJ EFN to discuss the early days of Hip Hop, helping Nas sign hi...</desc></programme><programme channel="400000004" start="20250907064500 +0000" stop="20250907091500 +0000"><title>Drink Champs</title><desc>Long Beach rapper Vince Staples joins N.O.R.E. and DJ EFN to discuss growing up in Long Beach, if he would...</desc></programme><programme channel="400000004" start="20250907091500 +0000" stop="20250907094500 +0000"><title>Soulja Boy Presents: The Life of Draco</title><desc>Soulja Boy gives an exclusive tour of his jaw-dropping LA mansion, featuring arcade games, a skate park, a...</desc></programme><programme channel="400000004" start="20250907094500 +0000" stop="20250907100000 +0000"><title>Soulja Boy Presents: The Life of Draco</title><desc>Soulja Boy and team return to Los Angeles and hit the studio to record his epic verse on Donda 2's "First ...</desc></programme><programme channel="400000004" start="20250907100000 +0000" stop="20250907110000 +0000"><title>Kingdom Culture with T.D.

For the last eighteen months ex Michelin-starred chef Nick has owned and run Rococo but his past success is now eluding him. The menu is past its sell-by date, the service is stuffy, the food is over-priced and the only thing being fed is his ego. Yet, despite debts of ~¬£100k and the prospect of putting his home at risk and his young family on the streets, Nick continues to cook comatose in a 1990s fantasy land of his own making.</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20250907030000 +0000" stop="20250907040000 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>In tonight's final programme of the series Gordon grapples with girl power when he takes on an intimate family-run restaurant in the heart of WAG territory near Liverpool. For the last three years Morgan's has been run by antiques dealer-turned-restaurateur SANDY and her two daughters HELEN and LAURA. The beautifully-designed dining room has a prime high street location and should be the perfect eatery for the trendy local clientele. But Head Chef Phil is grappling with an eclectic menu that includes mashed potato with apricots and his cooking's just not up to it.</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20250907040000 +0000" stop="20250907050000 +0000"><title>The F Word</title><desc>S05:E07 - Episode 7</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20250907050000 +0000" stop="20250907060000 +0000"><title>The F Word</title><desc>S05:E09 - Episode 9</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20250907060000 +0000" stop="20250907070000 +0000"><title>Next Level Chef (UK)</title><desc>There‚Äôs a Next Level Chef bombshell with the reveal that the team competition is over!

Barnaby and Jones discover that the victim was poisoned with a rare toxin extracted from Ecuadorean poison frogs - so the hunt is on for a particularly ruthless and imaginative killer. The detectives soon learn that a feud is raging between local occult practitioner Ernest Balliol and famous writer Aloysius Wilmington. While some of the villagers - such as Ernest's daughter Isolde - believe that powerful magical forces are at play, others think the reasons for the bloodshed may have their roots in the distant past. Barnaby and Jones soon find themselves delving into the occult, magic, and ancients books of power, to determine what happened, and soon sense a mixture of both might be the motive for the murder, when a book shop owner is killed with shattered glass, laced in the same poison.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20250908080000 +0000" stop="20250908100000 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>Barnaby and Jones are forced to take part in a team building exercise and Tom has plenty of problems dealing with the young, new, acting Chief Superintendent, John Cotton (Nick Fletcher).

James appears to be involved in shady business deals and is blamed by his grandmother Caroline Halsey (Judy Parfitt) - and others - for the suicide of a woman he got pregnant two years before.
