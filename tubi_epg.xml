Each had been sitting in their patrol cars when a man sneaked up and opened fire. The FBI was brought in to help catch the cop killer.  Agents identified the man who was most likely the killer, but he was nowhere to be found.  Months of surveillance operations around the country finally yielded a break; they found their suspect in Baltimore, MD.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000091" start="20251029172300 +0000" stop="20251029182000 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>On February 3, 1990, a 14-year-old girl ran away from her mother's home and disappeared without a trace.
