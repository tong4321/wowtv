The FBI began working with local police and slowly uncovered a multi-state crime ring run by a deadly drug lord who used violence and intimidation to keep those around him silent.

With no experience with this kind of predator, Viennese police turned to the FBI. FBI profilers were able to identify a suspect in the murders.
