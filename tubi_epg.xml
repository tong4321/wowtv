In Desert Ghost, Will Cooper heads west to Marathon, Texas, with longtime friend and mentor Cody Roberts to hunt aoudad in one of the most remote landscapes in the state. Rooted in family legacy, this film explores Cody’s deep ties to the desert, the story behind Desert Ghost Distillery, and the mystique of a western oasis near Big Bend National Park. More than a hunt, Desert Ghost dives into the role of aoudad management and its importance to desert bighorn sheep conservation efforts led by Texas Parks and Wildlife and the Wild Sheep Foundation. Sometimes, to protect what belongs here — you have to chase the ghosts. You really do have to be tough, determined, or one lucky bastard to make it out in West Texas.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20260129003010 +0000" stop="20260129010003 +0000"><title>The Bearded Buck</title><desc>With our annual "turkey tour" canceled due to COVID, Jerry and Austin go "all in" on the PA turkey season.

In Desert Ghost, Will Cooper heads west to Marathon, Texas, with longtime friend and mentor Cody Roberts to hunt aoudad in one of the most remote landscapes in the state. Rooted in family legacy, this film explores Cody’s deep ties to the desert, the story behind Desert Ghost Distillery, and the mystique of a western oasis near Big Bend National Park. More than a hunt, Desert Ghost dives into the role of aoudad management and its importance to desert bighorn sheep conservation efforts led by Texas Parks and Wildlife and the Wild Sheep Foundation. Sometimes, to protect what belongs here — you have to chase the ghosts. You really do have to be tough, determined, or one lucky bastard to make it out in West Texas.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20260129003010 +0000" stop="20260129010003 +0000"><title>The Bearded Buck</title><desc>With our annual "turkey tour" canceled due to COVID, Jerry and Austin go "all in" on the PA turkey season.
