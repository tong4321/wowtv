Next, Josh travels through the boroughs, heads upstate, and along the coast to source local ingredients—from sake brewers and pig farmers to catching fresh lobster just 100 miles from Wall Street. As always the adventure will end with a feast, right back in Chintan’s kitchen.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20250817050007 +0000" stop="20250817053007 +0000"><title>Dirt</title><desc>Hop in the float plane—a new episode of DIRT just dropped.

Two people are killed, and two are critically wounded.  At first the shootings seem targeted, then they seem random.  As the body count climbs, the killer taunts law enforcement with mysterious notes.  Agents believe the shooter will continue until he is deador behind bars.</desc></programme><programme channel="682630" start="20250817160000 +0000" stop="20250817170000 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>On a summer afternoon in upscale Lodi, California, a 12-year-old girl is abducted from her home.  Scores of police officers and FBI agents converge, determined to find the young girl before it is too late.  When the kidnapper's car is discovered in a field near Lodi, police dogs, helicopters, and hundreds of volunteers are employed in a round-the-clock search.  It would take a community united in concern for one of their youngest to find the missing child.</desc></programme><programme channel="682630" start="20250817170000 +0000" stop="20250817180000 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>In rural Texas, 13-year-old is kidnapped on her way to school.

Several months passed with no leads, then an FBI agent took a particular interest in the case.  Using a new technique known as criminal profiling, he predicted that the kidnapper would contact the girl's family on the one-year anniversary of her abduction.  When this prediction came true, the FBI agent noted behavioral clues, hoping that they could lead him to the kidnapper.</desc></programme><programme channel="682630" start="20250817190000 +0000" stop="20250817200000 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>When five-year-old Melissa Brannen disappeared from a Christmas party in December 1989, the only probable suspect was 24-year-old Caleb Hughes.  Hughes reportedly left the party around the time Melissa vanished, but no one saw him with the girl.  Fifty blue acrylic fibers collected during a search of Hughes' car, however, became the major piece of evidence in the case. FBI fiber analysis determined that those fibers were identical to the ones that made up the sweater Melissa was wearing.</desc></programme><programme channel="682630" start="20250817200000 +0000" stop="20250817210000 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>In 1994, a teenage immigrant came to the United States to realize her dream of becoming a doctor.
