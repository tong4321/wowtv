sensational era in TV talk show history. By exploring the psychological forces that shaped the talk TV genre, the series reveals how these shows transformed from trusted confessional spaces into lightning rods of controversy, leaving a lasting impact on culture, media and the people caught in the chaos.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20260131200000 +0000" stop="20260131210000 +0000"><title>What Would You Do?</title><desc>Using hidden cameras, host John Quiñones observes and comments on how ordinary people behave when they are confronted with dilemmas that require them either to take action or to walk by and mind their own business. Various scenarios are created that force people to make split-second -- and often surprising -- decisions, and variations of the situation (such as changing the genders, races or clothing of the people involved) are often featured to see if different reactions are elicited. Examples of situations on the show include a waitress being harassed by her boss, and a drunken valet trying to park cars.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20260131210000 +0000"

sensational era in TV talk show history. By exploring the psychological forces that shaped the talk TV genre, the series reveals how these shows transformed from trusted confessional spaces into lightning rods of controversy, leaving a lasting impact on culture, media and the people caught in the chaos.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20260131200000 +0000" stop="20260131210000 +0000"><title>What Would You Do?</title><desc>Using hidden cameras, host John Quiñones observes and comments on how ordinary people behave when they are confronted with dilemmas that require them either to take action or to walk by and mind their own business. Various scenarios are created that force people to make split-second -- and often surprising -- decisions, and variations of the situation (such as changing the genders, races or clothing of the people involved) are often featured to see if different reactions are elicited. Examples of situations on the show include a waitress being harassed by her boss, and a drunken valet trying to park cars.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20260131210000 +0000"

Having hunted Kentucky for over a decade and established my own properties—Bootleggers Ridge and Stonewall Plantation—I was eager for the chance at such a remarkable deer. Despite having drawn a coveted caribou tag through Worldwide Trophy Adventures’ TAGS Program, the allure of FREAK SHOW was too strong to resist. After careful planning and waiting for the right wind, I finally set out on September 11. With my crossbow in hand, I waited anxiously in the stand, my heart racing as the shadows lengthened.
