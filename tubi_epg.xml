A year has passed since Mark conquered the North America Waterfowl Slam. During the off-season, and with Covid just a memory, his focus shifted to thoughts of South America and the waterfowl species that it holds. After a few months of research and talking with the experts at Worldwide Trophy Adventures, he laid out the plan to attempt the South America slam in 2022. With 20 species on the list, Mark is now hunting ducks below the equator as they migrate North to warmer weather.

When the vehicle was recovered with three hundred thousand dollars and the drivers missing, suspicions that the crime was an inside job grew.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000091" start="20251214180600 +0000" stop="20251214190400 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>On a summer night in 1990, a body was discovered burning in a Minnesota alley.  Weeks later, police finally identified the victim, a suspected drug courier from California.  The FBI began working with local police and slowly uncovered a multi-state crime ring run by a deadly drug lord who used violence and intimidation to keep those around him silent.  Agents needed to infiltrate and dismantle the crew before more people died.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000091" start="20251214190400 +0000" stop="20251214200000 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>When a Delaware woman vanished in 1996, family and friends discovered her secret life.  The appointments secretary to the Governor had carried on an illicit affair with a wealthy married man.  Agents suspected that her powerful ex-lover was responsible, but they had little physical evidence to support their theory.  Investigators never found the woman's body or the murder weapon.  The FBI's only hope was to go undercover, and turn brother against brother.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000091" start="20251214200000 +0000" stop="20251214205700 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>By April of 1995 in Washington, D.C., two officers had been shot and one had been murdered. Each had been sitting in their patrol cars when a man sneaked up and opened fire. The FBI was brought in to help catch the cop killer.  Agents identified the man who was most likely the killer, but he was nowhere to be found.  Months of surveillance operations around the country finally yielded a break; they found their suspect in Baltimore, MD.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000091" start="20251214205700 +0000" stop="20251214215300 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>A stranger snatched an eight-year-old girl as she played in her Tucson, Arizona neighborhood, leaving behind an abandoned bicycle and a frantic mother.  Hundreds of citizens and police officers fanned out across the region, hoping to find some trace of the young girl or her abductor.  Within hours, a suspect emerged; a drifter who was out on parole for abducting and molesting children.

Hughes reportedly left the party around the time Melissa vanished, but no one saw him with the girl.  Fifty blue acrylic fibers collected during a search of Hughes' car, however, became the major piece of evidence in the case. FBI fiber analysis determined that those fibers were identical to the ones that made up the sweater Melissa was wearing.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000091" start="20251214225300 +0000" stop="20251214235400 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>On February 26, 1993, an explosion rocked the World Trade Center parking garage.
