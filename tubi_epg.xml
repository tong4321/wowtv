Volunteers were divided into teams and sent to six different sites along the river to collect insect nymphs and larvae—tiny but mighty indicators of water health.Over 223 specimens were gathered, from stoneflies and mayflies to dragonfly larvae. These macroinvertebrates are highly sensitive to their environment, and their presence (or absence) can tell us a lot about the state of the river.The results?

Volunteers were divided into teams and sent to six different sites along the river to collect insect nymphs and larvae—tiny but mighty indicators of water health.Over 223 specimens were gathered, from stoneflies and mayflies to dragonfly larvae. These macroinvertebrates are highly sensitive to their environment, and their presence (or absence) can tell us a lot about the state of the river.The results?

Next, Josh travels through the boroughs, heads upstate, and along the coast to source local ingredients—from sake brewers and pig farmers to catching fresh lobster just 100 miles from Wall Street. As always the adventure will end with a feast, right back in Chintan’s kitchen.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20250815153000 +0000" stop="20250815160000 +0000"><title>Dirt</title><desc>Hop in the float plane—a new episode of DIRT just dropped.
