It’s a colourful week with leotards, laughs and lots of ladies.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20251123210132 +0000" stop="20251123215424 +0000"><title>Wipeout Australia</title><desc>It’s Sitcom Central on Wipeout Australia with the Odd Couple, starring World’s Strongest Dwarf, David Clarke and Gentle Giant, Tim Watts.

When the post mortem confirms her death was no accident, the pair discover that nothing is what it seems to be within the little village as they try to find out what exactly she saw.

Before long, Barnaby and Jones are heading to Wales - former home to Delyth Mostyn, James's fiancee, to delve deeper into the mystery. There are certainly possible suspects in the murder and attempt on Kirkwood, from Delyth's children, who oppose the engagement, Delyth's husband, and more, as the detectives investigate things, in hopes of uncovering the truth before a major walk is to take place on Mount Snowdon.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20251123090000 +0000" stop="20251123110000 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>In the build-up to Luxton Deeping's annual photographic exhibition, a battle rages between the traditional and digital photographers of the pretty village. The dispute seems harmless enough - until Lionel Bell is found murdered in a nearby woodland, strangled with the cord of his light meter. Barnaby soon gets to work tracking down the killer, but it seems someone is trying to implicate the detective in the murder. And once he is replaced on the case, finding the culprit seems less likely than ever, as his replacement is more concerned of an upcoming wedding than the investigation. Barnaby is forced to work off the case to uncover who is framing him, and who wants dead other photographers in the village.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20251123110000 +0000" stop="20251123120000 +0000"><title>Murdoch Mysteries</title><desc>Julia discovers a secret about her father upon his death;
