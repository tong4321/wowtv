More than a hunt, Desert Ghost dives into the role of aoudad management and its importance to desert bighorn sheep conservation efforts led by Texas Parks and Wildlife and the Wild Sheep Foundation. Sometimes, to protect what belongs here — you have to chase the ghosts. You really do have to be tough, determined, or one lucky bastard to make it out in West Texas.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20260201033002 +0000" stop="20260201034036 +0000"><title>The WoodHaven Way</title><desc>In Missouri, we join Avery Epperson on the home farm with one goal in mind—catching up with a legendary buck known as Old Monroe.

After bagging two big bucks in just two days with his new Gunwerks Nexus 300 PRC, he is now moving to a new farm where a giant 12-point buck has often been seen in the southeast corner of the property. It’s the coldest day since he arrived, which typically means the deer will be more active. He is thrilled at the prospect of what could be the best day yet. If everything goes well, they will spend the evening hunting hogs from the high rack.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20260131214449 +0000" stop="20260131220001 +0000"><title>The Journey Within</title><desc>Mark is wrapping up his Argentina hunt and heading to Entre Rios to track down the final two birds on his list: the Rock Pigeon and the Eared Dove.

In Desert Ghost, Will Cooper heads west to Marathon, Texas, with longtime friend and mentor Cody Roberts to hunt aoudad in one of the most remote landscapes in the state. Rooted in family legacy, this film explores Cody’s deep ties to the desert, the story behind Desert Ghost Distillery, and the mystique of a western oasis near Big Bend National Park. More than a hunt, Desert Ghost dives into the role of aoudad management and its importance to desert bighorn sheep conservation efforts led by Texas Parks and Wildlife and the Wild Sheep Foundation. Sometimes, to protect what belongs here — you have to chase the ghosts. You really do have to be tough, determined, or one lucky bastard to make it out in West Texas.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20260201033002 +0000" stop="20260201034036 +0000"><title>The WoodHaven Way</title><desc>In Missouri, we join Avery Epperson on the home farm with one goal in mind—catching up with a legendary buck known as Old Monroe.
