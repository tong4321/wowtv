First up is Mayfair, with a prime location on the busy seafront in Fuengirola, Costa del Sol. The restaurant was set up 28 years ago by 68 year old Londoner Pat and her husband of 45 years, Jack. The good news is that Fuengirola is one of the only towns in Spain that has actually seen an increase in tourists since the recession with 1 and half million Brits visiting last year alone;  the bad news is that Mayfair isn't benefitting. With thousands of hungry sun seekers right on its doorstep, the restaurant should be raking it in - but the place is totally empty.</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20260301060000 +0000" stop="20260301070000 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>World-renowned chef Gordon Ramsay explores new territory in Ramsay's Costa del Nightmares, a four part series that sees him travel to Europe's holiday hotspots. Episode two sees Gordon tackle struggling Le Deck restaurant in Capbreton, a popular coastal town in South West France.  British owners Tim and Debbie emigrated to France 28 years ago, where they met as holiday reps.  Since then they've poured blood, sweat and tears into opening  3 ski restaurants in the Alps.  With the arrival of their children, they set up home by the coast to enjoy the summer months together as a family.  But unable to sit still, Tim launched Le Deck three years ago.  Far from being a hobby, the restaurant has taken over his life.</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20260301070000 +0000" stop="20260301080000 +0000"><title>The F Word</title><desc>S02:E04 - Episode 4</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20260301080000 +0000" stop="20260301090000 +0000"><title>The F Word</title><desc>S02:E05 - Episode 5</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20260301090000 +0000" stop="20260301100000 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Best Restaurant</title><desc>S01:E02 - Indian</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20260301100000 +0000" stop="20260301110000 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Best Restaurant</title><desc>S01:E03 - Chinese</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20260301110000 +0000" stop="20260301120000 +0000"><title>The F Word</title><desc>S02:E01 - Episode 1</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20260301120000 +0000" stop="20260301130000 +0000"><title>The F Word</title><desc>S02:E03 - Episode 3</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20260301130000 +0000" stop="20260301140000 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>World-renowned chef Gordon Ramsay explores new territory in Ramsay's Costa del Nightmares, a four part series that sees him travel to Europe's holiday hotspots.

Led by Cory Redwine, Conservation Director of Project SeaSafe, this is the 4th Annual Clean Water Collective and it’s bigger than ever. This time, we’re in Grant, Florida, where 4 million clams are being released into the Indian River Lagoon, paired with the planting of thousands of mangroves, oyster work by CCA and trash clean ups to help restore one of Florida’s most critical ecosystems. But it’s not just about hard work—it’s about connection. With local captains, fishing legends, and the Local Knowledge crew on hand, we hit the water to show why this place is worth fighting for. From clam drops by drone, to in-water mangrove planting, to monster snook catches, this is hands-on conservation at its best. This two-part series kicks off with action, heart, and the kind of hope only a healthy waterway can bring. Don’t miss Part 1—where conservation meets community and everyone gets their hands wet.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20260301233001 +0000" stop="20260302000001 +0000"><title>Local Knowledge</title><desc>As part of this year's Star brite Sea Safe event, we hit the water to experience some of the incredible fishing the Indian River Lagoon has to offer.
