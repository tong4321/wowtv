In more remote areas, access to water found in the Zambezi River is painstaking at best. Called by a higher power, “Brother Bill” Evans, a charismatic pastor from Kentucky, and Leonard Maronda, caretaker of the Mission House in Zimbabwe, have combined forces to drill borehole wells that bring free and fresh water to the remote villages of Zimbabwe. Brother Bill and Leonard have since installed a dozen wells and repaired a number of others, providing an estimated 44,000 gallons a day of clean, potable water to thousands of people in need of this vital resource. Above all, "Under the African Sun" is a touching story of hope: for Africa, for the future, for humanity.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20250912025227 +0000" stop="20250912030013 +0000"><title>Rivers are Life</title><desc>The Rivers are Life team joins the Michigan Department of Natural Resources on the St. Clair River to assist in catching and tagging lake sturgeon as part of an ongoing conservation effort.

Every year since its inception in 2012, Sturgeon Fest has released young sturgeon back into the wild, contributing to the unique species' resurgence in the Great Lakes region.

In more remote areas, access to water found in the Zambezi River is painstaking at best. Called by a higher power, “Brother Bill” Evans, a charismatic pastor from Kentucky, and Leonard Maronda, caretaker of the Mission House in Zimbabwe, have combined forces to drill borehole wells that bring free and fresh water to the remote villages of Zimbabwe. Brother Bill and Leonard have since installed a dozen wells and repaired a number of others, providing an estimated 44,000 gallons a day of clean, potable water to thousands of people in need of this vital resource. Above all, "Under the African Sun" is a touching story of hope: for Africa, for the future, for humanity.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20250912025227 +0000" stop="20250912030013 +0000"><title>Rivers are Life</title><desc>The Rivers are Life team joins the Michigan Department of Natural Resources on the St. Clair River to assist in catching and tagging lake sturgeon as part of an ongoing conservation effort. Aboard the DNR’s Channel Cat research vessel, we learn about the sturgeon's ecological role, cultural significance, and the challenges the iconic fish faces—from invasive species to habitat loss. The project supports sturgeon population recovery through egg collection, hatchery programs, and community events like Port Huron’s Sturgeon Fest, organized by the Friends of the St. Clair River. Every year since its inception in 2012, Sturgeon Fest has released young sturgeon back into the wild, contributing to the unique species' resurgence in the Great Lakes region. This year, the Rivers are Life team helped tag two juvenile sturgeons, which made their debut in the popular festival's touch tank before release.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20250912030013 +0000" stop="20250912033008 +0000"><title>Modern Hunter</title><desc>Join host Brad Rucks for a thrilling turkey hunting adventure across three unforgettable outings.
