But if the One gets a question wrong, he is eliminated and the remaining mob members split his winnings.</desc></programme><programme channel="673411" start="20250724111700 +0000" stop="20250724114200 +0000"><title>Tug of Words</title><desc>Based on the playground game Tug-O-War, teams of two compete to answer word-clue questions correctly and pull the flag on the tug of war rope to their side.</desc></programme><programme channel="673411" start="20250724114200 +0000" stop="20250724120800 +0000"><title>Tug of Words</title><desc>Based on the playground game Tug-O-War, teams of two compete to answer word-clue questions correctly and pull the flag on the tug of war rope to their side.</desc></programme><programme channel="673411" start="20250724120800 +0000" stop="20250724123400 +0000"><title>Family Feud</title><desc>Steve Harvey assumes the hosting duties for this daytime game show in which five members of one family are pitted against five members of another family.

When Agnes's cousin, Esslyn Carmichael, inadvertently cuts his own throat during the final act, it's quickly discovered that the tape on the prop blade he had used was removed without anyone knowing.
