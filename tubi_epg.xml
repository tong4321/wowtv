Confused, Detective Chief Inspector Barnaby and D.S. Jones can't work out whether it was a suicide pact or murder. Furthermore, they've got to find Miss Sharp and their investigation leads them to linking Simon and Laura with the villagers of Morton Fendle, who met at Elaine Trim's dancing classes.

Barnaby and Jones are soon on the case, trying to establish who would have wanted the elderly man dead.

During their opening performance, the band's singer, Mimi (Suzi Quatro), falls to the ground dead - electrocuted by a wire that had been run through the microphone stand. Barnaby and Jones soon find the rest of the band could be targets, and when another is killed, questions are raised as to whether former band member, Ginger Foxton, who went missing for 30 years and is presumed dead, is still at large.

At the lavish reception at Bledlow Hall that follows, however, tragedy strikes - maid of honour Marina Fellowes is found murdered in one of the rooms by some of the guests. With their honeymoon cancelled, the Fitzroys must contend with a police presence in their home, as Barnaby and Jones try to learn more about the family history. It soon becomes clear there are secrets, deception, and an illegtimate son involved in the mystery, which is further complicated when the estate manager is killed by an arrow.</desc></programme><channel id="671073"><display-name>Unsolved Mysteries</display-name><icon src="https://canvas-lb.tubitv.com/opts/5DVrF33Bfks10w==/864892f9-3ab0-4950-9f8b-189ec2d92c20/CHgQeDoFMS4xLjhAAQ==" /></channel><programme channel="671073" start="20251130154500 +0000" stop="20251130164400 +0000"><title>Unsolved Mysteries With Robert Stack</title><desc>Chair of Death; Coma Healer; Animal Saviors; Holy Grail; Signs from Heaven.</desc></programme><programme channel="671073" start="20251130164400 +0000" stop="20251130174200 +0000"><title>Unsolved Mysteries With Robert Stack</title><desc>Suspect turned victim and update; David Lee Kemp and update; internet abduction and update; love is blind.</desc></programme><programme channel="671073" start="20251130174200 +0000" stop="20251130183900 +0000"><title>Unsolved Mysteries With Robert Stack</title><desc>This episode includes: Doris Duke &amp; UD, UD: Foster Son, Vietnam Orphans, Puerto Rican Monster and Money From Heaven.</desc></programme><programme channel="671073" start="20251130183900 +0000" stop="20251130193700 +0000"><title>Unsolved Mysteries With Robert Stack</title><desc>The Other Intern and update; Artist for the Persecution; Waag, the Dog and update; Patti's Little Girls and update.</desc></programme><programme channel="671073" start="20251130193700 +0000" stop="20251130203600 +0000"><title>Unsolved Mysteries With Robert Stack</title><desc>This episode includes: Comedy Store Ghosts, New Year's Samaritan &amp; UD, UD: Fritz &amp; the Soldiers, NY Serial Rapist &amp; UD and Suspicious Suicide.</desc></programme><programme channel="671073" start="20251130203600 +0000" stop="20251130212900 +0000"><title>Unsolved Mysteries With Robert Stack</title><desc>Rudolph on the Run and update; Racial Rift and update; Child Prodigies; Lifeguard Missing (Molly Bish) and update.</desc></programme><programme channel="671073" start="20251130212900 +0000" stop="20251130222200 +0000"><title>Unsolved Mysteries With Robert Stack</title><desc>Wood I Lie to You?; Wanted Weaver and update; What Happened to Natasha?
