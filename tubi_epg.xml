La Parra de Burriana is an ex-pat restaurant in Nerja on Spain's Costa del Sol. Nestling among the cafes lining the seafront offering all-day English breakfast and chips, La Parra is the brainchild of twenty-six-year-old ex-nightclub manager Laurence. He set himself up in business eighteen months ago with a loan from his dad and, although he's not an experienced chef, mans the kitchen on his own, determined to offer something better than chips to his largely British clientele.</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20260105060000 +0000" stop="20260105070000 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>In tonight's second programme Gordon tackles a pub for the first time, getting to grips with The Fenwick Arms in rural Lancashire. The pub is run by landlord Brian who, after thirty years in the business and a quadruple heart-bypass, still puts in 120 hours a week and insists on laying down the law in the kitchen. Despite their best endeavours Brian and his partner Elaine are ~£250k in debt, losing ~1500 a week and facing bankruptcy within three months unless there's a drastic reversal in their fortunes.</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20260105070000 +0000" stop="20260105080000 +0000"><title>The F Word</title><desc>S04:E07 - Episode 7</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20260105080000 +0000" stop="20260105090000 +0000"><title>The F Word</title><desc>S04:E08 - Episode 8</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20260105090000 +0000" stop="20260105100000 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Best Restaurant</title><desc>S01:E10 - Semi Final 2</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20260105100000 +0000" stop="20260105110000 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Best Restaurant</title><desc>S01:E11 - Final</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20260105110000 +0000" stop="20260105120000 +0000"><title>Next Level Chef</title><desc>Contestants prepare a next-level burger.</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20260105120000 +0000" stop="20260105130000 +0000"><title>Next Level Chef</title><desc>Creating a brunch; sweet and savory brunch dish.</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20260105130000 +0000" stop="20260105140000 +0000"><title>Kitchen Nightmares - Censored</title><desc>Chef Ramsay treks to Boston to visit La Galleria 33, an Italian restaurant managed by sisters.

Volunteers were divided into teams and sent to six different sites along the river to collect insect nymphs and larvae—tiny but mighty indicators of water health.Over 223 specimens were gathered, from stoneflies and mayflies to dragonfly larvae. These macroinvertebrates are highly sensitive to their environment, and their presence (or absence) can tell us a lot about the state of the river.The results? Based on initial identifications, the Cedar River shows signs of excellent water quality—making it one of Michigan’s prized Blue Ribbon Trout Streams.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20260106035524 +0000" stop="20260106040004 +0000"><title>Rivers are Life</title><desc>Why do Rivers are Life impact projects matter?

Led by Cory Redwine, Conservation Director of Project SeaSafe, this is the 4th Annual Clean Water Collective and it’s bigger than ever. This time, we’re in Grant, Florida, where 4 million clams are being released into the Indian River Lagoon, paired with the planting of thousands of mangroves, oyster work by CCA and trash clean ups to help restore one of Florida’s most critical ecosystems. But it’s not just about hard work—it’s about connection. With local captains, fishing legends, and the Local Knowledge crew on hand, we hit the water to show why this place is worth fighting for. From clam drops by drone, to in-water mangrove planting, to monster snook catches, this is hands-on conservation at its best. This two-part series kicks off with action, heart, and the kind of hope only a healthy waterway can bring. Don’t miss Part 1—where conservation meets community and everyone gets their hands wet.</desc></programme><channel id="400000000"><display-name>Waypoint TV</display-name><icon src="https://canvas-lb.tubitv.com/opts/j5_965C-CDR-0w==/4b2bb660-9424-45c9-ad67-9c7099f60cbf/CHgQeDoFMS4xLjhAAQ==" /></channel><programme channel="400000000" start="20260105020001 +0000" stop="20260105023000 +0000"><title>Local Knowledge</title><desc>Ali heads East to fish for the usual in Key West, but Rush always has another trick up his sleeve.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20260105023000 +0000" stop="20260105030001 +0000"><title>Local Knowledge</title><desc>The ability to overcome obstacles and challenging conditions can be key to success, but when fishing in Key West, cold temps are rarely the hurdle.

Volunteers were divided into teams and sent to six different sites along the river to collect insect nymphs and larvae—tiny but mighty indicators of water health.Over 223 specimens were gathered, from stoneflies and mayflies to dragonfly larvae. These macroinvertebrates are highly sensitive to their environment, and their presence (or absence) can tell us a lot about the state of the river.The results? Based on initial identifications, the Cedar River shows signs of excellent water quality—making it one of Michigan’s prized Blue Ribbon Trout Streams.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20260106035524 +0000" stop="20260106040004 +0000"><title>Rivers are Life</title><desc>Why do Rivers are Life impact projects matter?

Led by Cory Redwine, Conservation Director of Project SeaSafe, this is the 4th Annual Clean Water Collective and it’s bigger than ever. This time, we’re in Grant, Florida, where 4 million clams are being released into the Indian River Lagoon, paired with the planting of thousands of mangroves, oyster work by CCA and trash clean ups to help restore one of Florida’s most critical ecosystems. But it’s not just about hard work—it’s about connection. With local captains, fishing legends, and the Local Knowledge crew on hand, we hit the water to show why this place is worth fighting for. From clam drops by drone, to in-water mangrove planting, to monster snook catches, this is hands-on conservation at its best. This two-part series kicks off with action, heart, and the kind of hope only a healthy waterway can bring.
