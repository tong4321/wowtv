The contestant, known as the One, competes with a mob of 100 other players by answering questions. When the One answers correctly, each member of the mob that answered incorrectly is eliminated. The One earns money for each mob member who is eliminated. If the One can eliminate the entire mob, he wins $50,000. But if the One gets a question wrong, he is eliminated and the remaining mob members split his winnings.</desc></programme><programme channel="673411" start="20250730141700 +0000" stop="20250730144300 +0000"><title>Tug of Words</title><desc>Based on the playground game Tug-O-War, teams of two compete to answer word-clue questions correctly and pull the flag on the tug of war rope to their side.</desc></programme><programme channel="673411" start="20250730144300 +0000" stop="20250730150900 +0000"><title>Tug of Words</title><desc>Based on the playground game Tug-O-War, teams of two compete to answer word-clue questions correctly and pull the flag on the tug of war rope to their side.</desc></programme><programme channel="673411" start="20250730150900 +0000" stop="20250730153400 +0000"><title>Family Feud</title><desc>Steve Harvey assumes the hosting duties for this daytime game show in which five members of one family are pitted against five members of another family.

One of the most legendary big-bass lakes in the world—and one of the most humbling.In this episode of Dirty 30, everything I thought I knew got thrown out the window. Decades of experience? Didn’t matter. Past patterns? Useless. This one was all about adjusting on the fly, staying present, and grinding it out with one mantra in mind:Fish the Moment.When it got tough—when the bite shut down, when the pressure kicked in—there was only one thing left to do:Just Keep on Fishing.This is the raw, honest side of professional bass fishing. The mental battle. The stubborn faith. The relentless grind that separates the good days from the unforgettable ones.Watch as I dig deep on Lake Fork, fight through adversity, and chase greatness the only way I know how—cast by cast.Welcome to Dirty 30.

Justin Leake and his cousin encounter when December turns unseasonably warm. It’s a grey morning with thick fog so Justin and Capt. Brent Berry won’t be heading offshore right away as planned. Instead, Justin turns to his Humminbird CoastMaster charts to pinpoint a near shore artificial reef just five minutes from the St. Andrews Pass, where the anglers will do a little fishing until the fog burns off. Capt. Leake opts to send a jig to the bottom and he’s not very picky about the one that gets tied on. “When fishing reefs, the specific jig doesn’t matter because it’s all about the presentation,” he says. “When you’re sitting on top of a wreck, break out the ‘junk jigs’ – they get bit just fine.” And that proves to be the case as Justin and Brent enjoy non-stop battles against amberjack, red snapper and bonita. And with a bite this good, there’s no reason to go anywhere else!

Justin Leake and his cousin encounter when December turns unseasonably warm. It’s a grey morning with thick fog so Justin and Capt. Brent Berry won’t be heading offshore right away as planned. Instead, Justin turns to his Humminbird CoastMaster charts to pinpoint a near shore artificial reef just five minutes from the St. Andrews Pass, where the anglers will do a little fishing until the fog burns off. Capt. Leake opts to send a jig to the bottom and he’s not very picky about the one that gets tied on. “When fishing reefs, the specific jig doesn’t matter because it’s all about the presentation,” he says. “When you’re sitting on top of a wreck, break out the ‘junk jigs’ – they get bit just fine.” And that proves to be the case as Justin and Brent enjoy non-stop battles against amberjack, red snapper and bonita. And with a bite this good, there’s no reason to go anywhere else!

While Troy is allowed to assist them, Barnaby is left handling a local operation into a spate of thefts, yet he decides to continue his investigations in secret.
