Journey South Outfitters for an unforgettable inshore fishing adventure in the heart of the Mississippi River Delta. With reports of massive schools of redfish cruising the beaches, Monique (“Moe”) must decide whether to trust the intel and make a bold run down the coast—or rely on her own instincts built from years on the water. The mission is simple: put Rush on a true bull redfish and see if he has what it takes to earn a spot in her coveted “Over 40-Inch Club.” This trip highlights why Venice, Louisiana is considered one of the premier inshore fisheries in the country—and why having the right guide makes all the difference.

The mission is simple: put Rush on a true bull redfish and see if he has what it takes to earn a spot in her coveted “Over 40-Inch Club.” This trip highlights why Venice, Louisiana is considered one of the premier inshore fisheries in the country—and why having the right guide makes all the difference.

When the post mortem confirms her death was no accident, the pair discover that nothing is what it seems to be within the little village as they try to find out what exactly she saw. Their investigation introduces Barnaby and Troy to many eccentric and quirky residents and soon turns up a web of sex, blackmail and lies, and the possibility that the murder could be connected to a shooting accident two years ago, which claimed another woman's life.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20260127173600 +0000" stop="20260127194000 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>After debating on who their next guest speaker should be, the Midsomer Worthy Writers' Circle decide to invite famous writer, Max Jennings, to their next meeting, despite opposition to the choice by Gerald Hadleigh, the group's chairman.

When Agnes's cousin, Esslyn Carmichael, inadvertently cuts his own throat during the final act, it's quickly discovered that the tape on the prop blade he had used was removed without anyone knowing.
