Files</title><desc>In June 1973, a young girl was abducted from a state park on the Missouri River while camping with her family.  Several months passed with no leads, then an FBI agent took a particular interest in the case.  Using a new technique known as criminal profiling, he predicted that the kidnapper would contact the girl's family on the one-year anniversary of her abduction.  When this prediction came true, the FBI agent noted behavioral clues, hoping that they could lead him to the kidnapper.</desc></programme><programme channel="682630" start="20250711100000 +0000" stop="20250711110000 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>When five-year-old Melissa Brannen disappeared from a Christmas party in December 1989, the only probable suspect was 24-year-old Caleb Hughes.  Hughes reportedly left the party around the time Melissa vanished, but no one saw him with the girl.  Fifty blue acrylic fibers collected during a search of Hughes' car, however, became the major piece of evidence in the case. FBI fiber analysis determined that those fibers were identical to the ones that made up the sweater Melissa was wearing.</desc></programme><programme channel="682630" start="20250711110000 +0000" stop="20250711120000 +0000"><title>VPI: Vinnie Politan Investigates</title><desc>Description Unavailable</desc></programme><programme channel="682630" start="20250711120000 +0000" stop="20250711130000 +0000"><title>Opening Statements With Julie Grant</title><desc>Former prosecutor Julie Grant is joined by a team of top trial attorneys and forensic experts to cover the high-stakes trials that are on the docket, and the crime cases dominating the headlines.</desc></programme><programme channel="682630" start="20250711130000 +0000" stop="20250711140000 +0000"><title>Court TV Live</title><desc>Gavel-to-gavel coverage and legal analysis of the nation's most compelling trials.</desc></programme><programme channel="682630" start="20250711140000 +0000" stop="20250711150000 +0000"><title>Court TV Live</title><desc>Gavel-to-gavel coverage and legal analysis of the nation's most compelling trials.</desc></programme><programme channel="682630" start="20250711150000 +0000" stop="20250711160000 +0000"><title>Court TV Live</title><desc>Gavel-to-gavel coverage and legal analysis of the nation's most compelling trials.</desc></programme><programme channel="682630" start="20250711160000 +0000" stop="20250711170000 +0000"><title>Court TV Live</title><desc>Gavel-to-gavel coverage and legal analysis of the nation's most compelling trials.</desc></programme><programme channel="682630" start="20250711170000 +0000" stop="20250711180000 +0000"><title>Court TV Live</title><desc>Gavel-to-gavel coverage and legal analysis of the nation's most compelling trials.</desc></programme><programme channel="682630" start="20250711180000 +0000" stop="20250711190000 +0000"><title>Court TV Live</title><desc>Gavel-to-gavel coverage and legal analysis of the nation's most compelling trials.</desc></programme><programme channel="682630" start="20250711190000 +0000" stop="20250711200000 +0000"><title>Court TV Live</title><desc>Gavel-to-gavel coverage and legal analysis of the nation's most compelling trials.</desc></programme><programme channel="682630" start="20250711200000 +0000" stop="20250711210000 +0000"><title>Court TV Live</title><desc>Gavel-to-gavel coverage and legal analysis of the nation's most compelling trials.</desc></programme><programme channel="682630" start="20250711210000 +0000" stop="20250711220000 +0000"><title>Court TV Live</title><desc>Gavel-to-gavel coverage and legal analysis of the nation's most compelling trials.</desc></programme><programme channel="682630" start="20250711220000 +0000" stop="20250711230000 +0000"><title>Court TV Live</title><desc>Gavel-to-gavel coverage and legal analysis of the nation's most compelling trials.</desc></programme><programme channel="682630" start="20250711230000 +0000" stop="20250712000000 +0000"><title>48 Hours</title><desc>A young alcoholic woman seeking help with her addiction falls in love with a killer.</desc></programme><channel id="641492"><display-name>Nosey</display-name><icon src="https://canvas-lb.tubitv.com/opts/39R7mJDwC44sJQ==/22eaf49e-a2ad-4da4-afbd-66aedb72c78f/CHgQeDoFMS4xLjdAAQ==" /></channel><programme channel="641492" start="20250710122842 +0000" stop="20250710131510 +0000"><title>The Jerry Springer Show</title><desc>Steve helps a pregnant prostitute change her lifestyle.</desc></programme><programme channel="641492" start="20250710131510 +0000" stop="20250710140125 +0000"><title>The Jerry Springer Show</title><desc>Brandy's boyfriend cheated during a break, and the other woman won’t back off.
