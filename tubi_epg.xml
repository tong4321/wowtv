with men trying to oppose an event that the women have managed to successfully hold without interruption, until it culminates with casualties on both sides - Mildred Danvers, an elderly woman who had returned on the day of a funeral and poisoned in her hotel room, and Rev. Anthony Gant, shot during a major event being held in the village green, in view of many. It soon becomes clear someone may have wished to kill both to cover up a dark truth, and soon Barnaby has to figure out who amongst the village wanted both dead, complicated further when Gant's curate is murdered next.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20250824205100 +0000" stop="20250824224200 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>Villagers in Elverton-cum-Latterly are up in arms and divided, over the building of a supermarket. Things soon come to a head when independent environmental supervisor, Frank Hopkirk, is found stabbed to death at a Jubb's Timber Yard, the site of the new supermarket, by a pair of children. When Barnaby and Jones investigate to determine who wanted Hopkirk dead, they find out that he secretly came to the village under various aliases for sexual rendezvous with various women in fantasy role-playing scenarios, and that he had been making further investigations on the future development site and having doubts over claims it was contaminated. Either someone didn't like his investigations, or someone didn't like his sexual appetite, but either way, Barnaby finds himself investigating lies and more to uncover the truth.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20250824224200 +0000" stop="20250825003000 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>Barnaby and DC Ben Jones (Jason Hughes) find themselves attempting to unravel the deaths of a choir tenor, and later a bird watcher, before more murders occur.

Barnaby and Jones are soon on the case, trying to establish who would have wanted the elderly man dead.

During their opening performance, the band's singer, Mimi (Suzi Quatro), falls to the ground dead - electrocuted by a wire that had been run through the microphone stand. Barnaby and Jones soon find the rest of the band could be targets, and when another is killed, questions are raised as to whether former band member, Ginger Foxton, who went missing for 30 years and is presumed dead, is still at large.

Shortly before leaving their hotel they mention they haven't been able to find what they're looking for; "something old and derelict that they can do up." Anne Merrick tells them about Winyard, a tumbledown cottage in the woods, might be for sale. At the estate agents they are told the house is not yet available for viewing. Later that evening they find the house on their own. However, Caroline has read up on the cottage's haunted reputation and only reluctantly explores it with Peter. The next morning they are found strangled in their own car. DCI Barnaby starts the investigation with the help of PC Ben Jones and they come across the world of estate agents, identical twins, ghosts, piano wire, and more before another body turns up.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20250825080000 +0000" stop="20250825100000 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>Villagers of Midsomer Barton are all set to celebrate Oak Apple Week, especially as the carnival queen event is set to return after an eight year absence. Yet the body of the mother of a deceased, one-time carnival queen, found in a stream, looks set to spoil things, as Barnaby and Jones find themselves digging up the past. From familiar faces, to drunken boasts and hidden obessions, it slowly becomes clear that the mother's daughter might be the key to solving the murder, when more deaths follow.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20250825100000 +0000" stop="20250825110000 +0000"><title>Private Eyes</title><desc>A stalker targets a female golf pro during a celebrity
