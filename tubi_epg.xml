This year’s invigorating action display includes: a rare and insightful segment on ski racing king and perceived industry bad boy, Bode Miller; a trip to Alaska’s untouched Chugach Range with X-Games Gold Medalists, and brothers, Zach and Reggie Crist; unbelievably deep powder in Utah and British Columbia; and astonishing aerial acrobatics from Sweden, and so much more. PLAYGROUND also highlights the future of snowboarding in a segment featuring the youth-infused Burton Smalls Team in which these young prodigies teach us that size truly isn’t everything.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000005" start="20260115110000 +0000" stop="20260115113000 +0000"><title>In the Zone</title><desc>We check out the 2021 Sydney Harbour Challenge in

How much is acceptable among three contestants in each episode is determined by the "dater," who hears the candidates' intimate secrets and hidden flaws, as well as their attempts to deflect these traits by describing their positive attributes. After two elimination rounds leave one remaining contestant, it's the dater's turn to reveal his or her own baggage ... and then the contestant decides to go forward with the date or not.

Following an explosion in a truck that had been stored in a truck depot, a body is soon discovered in a nearby lake, which turns out to be Alec Grainger, who had been seen arguing with James Parkes (Joseph Millson), the son of Colonel Matt Parkes (Tim Pigott-Smith). James appears to be involved in shady business deals and is blamed by his grandmother Caroline Halsey (Judy Parfitt) - and others - for the suicide of a woman he got pregnant two years before.
