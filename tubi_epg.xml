Police searched for answers, but found none. The horrible crime appeared unmotivated, senseless, and random. Then, family members offered a startling clue.  The victim, the wife of a prominent Atlanta attorney, was also a woman burdened with a secret; a secret the FBI believed led to her death.  It would force local and federal agents to untangle an intricate web of money, drugs and murder.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000091" start="20260222190800 +0000" stop="20260222200700 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>On Mississippi's Gulf Coast, a judge and his politician wife were brutally murdered in their home.  The killer left few clues and the investigation led nowhere.  But the FBI was patiently waiting in the wings.  Once it was determined that federal laws had been violated, they pounced on the investigation. They uncovered a corrupt local government and a group of violent criminal conspirators known as the Dixie Mafia, responsible for fraud, money laundering and murder.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000091" start="20260222200700 +0000" stop="20260222210700 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>California Highway Patrolman George Gwaltney discovered the body of 23-year-old Robin Bishop near her car on a remote desert highway.

Lured by the easy wealth of the narcotics industry, crooked cops began breaking the laws they were sworn to uphold. They would stop at nothing, including murder, to protect their rackets. When it became clear they could no longer police themselves, the FBI got involved. Putting their lives on the line, undercover agents devised a way to flush out the violent cops and restore trust in the city's police force.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000091" start="20260222220500 +0000" stop="20260222230400 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>In 1984, south Miami became the home for a sadistic serial killer.

However, Barnaby - a former spy himself - soon realises that the killing has links to Allenby House and Cold War Berlin, but is initially thrown off the case by MI6.
