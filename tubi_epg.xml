Various scenarios are created that force people to make split-second -- and often surprising -- decisions, and variations of the situation (such as changing the genders, races or clothing of the people involved) are often featured to see if different reactions are elicited. Examples of situations on the show include a waitress being harassed by her boss, and a drunken valet trying to park cars.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20251115210000 +0000" stop="20251115213000 +0000"><title>ABC News Live Weekend: Saturday</title><desc>Breaking news coverage and live video.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20251115213000 +0000" stop="20251115220000 +0000"><title>Call to Serve</title><desc>Description Unavailable</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20251115220000 +0000" stop="20251115223000 +0000"><title>ABC News Live Weekend: Saturday</title><desc>Breaking news coverage and live video.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20251115223000 +0000" stop="20251115230000 +0000"><title>All Access With Linsey Davis</title><desc>A 30-minute interview franchise of ABC News Live "Prime With Linsey Davis" featuring candid conversations with celebrities, musicians, and newsmakers from across the cultural landscape.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20251115230000 +0000" stop="20251116010000 +0000"><title>20/20</title><desc>Award-winning program anchored by David Muir, featuring unforgettable, character-driven true crime mysteries, exclusive newsmaker interviews, hard-hitting investigative reports and in-depth coverage of high profile stories.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20251116010000 +0000" stop="20251116030000 +0000"><title>20/20</title><desc>Award-winning program anchored by David Muir, featuring unforgettable, character-driven true crime mysteries, exclusive newsmaker interviews, hard-hitting investigative reports and in-depth coverage of high profile stories.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20251116030000 +0000" stop="20251116040000 +0000"><title>The Golden Girls: 40 Years of Laughter and Friendship -- A Special Edition of 20/20</title><desc>A behind-the-scenes look at the beloved sitcom's enduring impact on TV and culture, including interviews with superfans Sheryl Lee Ralph, Kelly Ripa, Laverne Cox and former guest star Mario Lopez.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20251116040000 +0000" stop="20251116060000 +0000"><title>20/20</title><desc>Award-winning program anchored by David Muir, featuring unforgettable, character-driven true crime mysteries, exclusive newsmaker interviews, hard-hitting investigative reports and in-depth coverage of high profile stories.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20251116060000 +0000" stop="20251116080000 +0000"><title>20/20</title><desc>Award-winning program anchored by David Muir, featuring unforgettable, character-driven true crime mysteries, exclusive newsmaker interviews, hard-hitting investigative reports and in-depth coverage of high profile stories.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20251116080000 +0000" stop="20251116090000 +0000"><title>The Golden Girls: 40 Years of Laughter and Friendship -- A Special Edition of 20/20</title><desc>A behind-the-scenes look at the beloved sitcom's enduring impact on TV and culture, including interviews with superfans Sheryl Lee Ralph, Kelly Ripa, Laverne Cox and former guest star Mario Lopez.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20251116090000 +0000" stop="20251116110000 +0000"><title>20/20</title><desc>Award-winning program anchored by David Muir, featuring unforgettable, character-driven true crime mysteries, exclusive newsmaker interviews, hard-hitting investigative reports and in-depth coverage of high profile stories.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20251116110000 +0000" stop="20251116113000 +0000"><title>ABC News Live Weekend</title><desc>Breaking news coverage and live video.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20251116113000 +0000" stop="20251116120000 +0000"><title>GMA Life</title><desc>A weekly roundup of the best lifestyle content from "Good Morning America";

When the post mortem confirms her death was no accident, the pair discover that nothing is what it seems to be within the little village as they try to find out what exactly she saw. Their investigation introduces Barnaby and Troy to many eccentric and quirky residents and soon turns up a web of sex, blackmail and lies, and the possibility that the murder could be connected to a shooting accident two years ago, which claimed another woman's life.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20251115134900 +0000" stop="20251115155300 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>After debating on who their next guest speaker should be, the Midsomer Worthy Writers' Circle decide to invite famous writer, Max Jennings, to their next meeting, despite opposition to the choice by Gerald Hadleigh, the group's chairman.

When Agnes's cousin, Esslyn Carmichael, inadvertently cuts his own throat during the final act, it's quickly discovered that the tape on the prop blade he had used was removed without anyone knowing.
