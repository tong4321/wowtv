P.S. if you're hungry for more Japan content, stay tuned for our next two episodes.In this episode of DIRT, the crew road tripped around Kyushu. The food culture in Kyushu dates back to the emperors of Japan, and the Black Current off the eastern shore has shaped the island's cuisine for centuries. The DIRT team followed that current up the coastline, surfing with new friends and tasting new flavors. And with each stop, we learned even more about how the traditions we keep can honor thousands of years of knowledge—and point the way to the future."</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20251112040023 +0000" stop="20251112042243 +0000"><title>Fishing With Jay</title><desc>Brandon "Eazy" Thompson is more than our local barber, he's an avid angler, hunter, and dedicated outdoorsman.

Al and Marg drove down to south Florida and met the owner – a young guy who had had big plans for his first boat but had been hit hard by Covid and needed the cash. When they drove up to the Bajío office with it in tow, everyone was stoked. Our first thought was, “wow, this thing is perfect.  It’s ready to go!” It’s pretty basic, but that’s what pangas are. All we need is a bamboo pole and we’re good.  When Jay showed up, he started making a list of a few things that we might need to add. A casting platform was kind of mandatory. A poling platform would be needed as well. A floor and a couple seats would make the ride easier on everybody. Some rod holders. A cooler. GPS. Lights…The list started growing. All of sudden, our little basic panga was in need some fairly big upgrades.Jay thought it would be helpful to find a local boat builder that would let us do the work in their facility.  His thinking was that we could make a trade. They give us space, teach us how to do boat building, let us use their tools and all of the materials. In return…well, we didn’t have a lot to offer. Some free shades? The pleasure of Jay’s company? Some love in the film we were making?We made some calls. No takers. More calls. Still no takers.Then one day, the local Chamber of Commerce decided to through us a welcome party. Super nice of them. We had a big crowd of local business owners show up. One was a woman named Sarah Dougherty. She and her husband own Dougherty Boatworks and Sōlace Boats.  “Whatever we can do help, just let us know.” Bingo! “Would you guys like to be in a film?”  What an amazing stroke of luck. Steven Dougherty is a legendary boat builder. He’s the guy other boat builders come to when they need advice. And he would be helping us build our panga!  Sweet! Check it out…#fishingwithjay</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20251112043005 +0000" stop="20251112050000 +0000"><title>Goin' Coastal</title><desc>The bite’s dead during a neap tide, but Josh and Isaiah don’t back down.

Al and Marg drove down to south Florida and met the owner – a young guy who had had big plans for his first boat but had been hit hard by Covid and needed the cash. When they drove up to the Bajío office with it in tow, everyone was stoked. Our first thought was, “wow, this thing is perfect.  It’s ready to go!” It’s pretty basic, but that’s what pangas are. All we need is a bamboo pole and we’re good.  When Jay showed up, he started making a list of a few things that we might need to add. A casting platform was kind of mandatory. A poling platform would be needed as well. A floor and a couple seats would make the ride easier on everybody. Some rod holders. A cooler. GPS. Lights…The list started growing. All of sudden, our little basic panga was in need some fairly big upgrades.Jay thought it would be helpful to find a local boat builder that would let us do the work in their facility.  His thinking was that we could make a trade. They give us space, teach us how to do boat building, let us use their tools and all of the materials. In return…well, we didn’t have a lot to offer. Some free shades? The pleasure of Jay’s company? Some love in the film we were making?We made some calls. No takers. More calls. Still no takers.Then one day, the local Chamber of Commerce decided to through us a welcome party. Super nice of them. We had a big crowd of local business owners show up. One was a woman named Sarah Dougherty. She and her husband own Dougherty Boatworks and Sōlace Boats.  “Whatever we can do help, just let us know.” Bingo! “Would you guys like to be in a film?”  What an amazing stroke of luck. Steven Dougherty is a legendary boat builder. He’s the guy other boat builders come to when they need advice. And he would be helping us build our panga!  Sweet!

Shortly before leaving their hotel they mention they haven't been able to find what they're looking for; "something old and derelict that they can do up." Anne Merrick tells them about Winyard, a tumbledown cottage in the woods, might be for sale. At the estate agents they are told the house is not yet available for viewing. Later that evening they find the house on their own. However, Caroline has read up on the cottage's haunted reputation and only reluctantly explores it with Peter. The next morning they are found strangled in their own car. DCI Barnaby starts the investigation with the help of PC Ben Jones and they come across the world of estate agents, identical twins, ghosts, piano wire, and more before another body turns up.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20251113170000 +0000" stop="20251113190000 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>Villagers of Midsomer Barton are all set to celebrate Oak Apple Week, especially as the carnival queen event is set to return after an eight year absence.
