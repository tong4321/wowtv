Aboard the DNR’s Channel Cat research vessel, we learn about the sturgeon's ecological role, cultural significance, and the challenges the iconic fish faces—from invasive species to habitat loss. The project supports sturgeon population recovery through egg collection, hatchery programs, and community events like Port Huron’s Sturgeon Fest, organized by the Friends of the St. Clair River. Every year since its inception in 2012, Sturgeon Fest has released young sturgeon back into the wild, contributing to the unique species' resurgence in the Great Lakes region. This year, the Rivers are Life team helped tag two juvenile sturgeons, which made their debut in the popular festival's touch tank before release.</desc></programme><channel id="400000000"><display-name>Waypoint TV</display-name><icon src="https://canvas-lb.tubitv.com/opts/j5_965C-CDR-0w==/4b2bb660-9424-45c9-ad67-9c7099f60cbf/CHgQeDoFMS4xLjhAAQ==" /></channel><programme channel="400000000" start="20251127123001 +0000" stop="20251127130001 +0000"><title>Destination Dive</title><desc>On this show we highlight some of the best diving in the lower Keys.

Aboard the DNR’s Channel Cat research vessel, we learn about the sturgeon's ecological role, cultural significance, and the challenges the iconic fish faces—from invasive species to habitat loss. The project supports sturgeon population recovery through egg collection, hatchery programs, and community events like Port Huron’s Sturgeon Fest, organized by the Friends of the St. Clair River. Every year since its inception in 2012, Sturgeon Fest has released young sturgeon back into the wild, contributing to the unique species' resurgence in the Great Lakes region. This year, the Rivers are Life team helped tag two juvenile sturgeons, which made their debut in the popular festival's touch tank before release.</desc></programme><channel id="400000065"><display-name>Top Gear</display-name><icon src="https://canvas-lb.tubitv.com/opts/g_SN11NtWr_adw==/45d06aa3-8a80-4864-a7b0-25a606d26be3/CHgQeDoFMS4xLjhAAQ==" /></channel><programme channel="400000065" start="20251127121302 +0000" stop="20251127131126 +0000"><title>Top Gear UK</title><desc>Jeremy, Richard and James revisit their attempt to build amphibious cars.
