Volunteers were divided into teams and sent to six different sites along the river to collect insect nymphs and larvae—tiny but mighty indicators of water health.Over 223 specimens were gathered, from stoneflies and mayflies to dragonfly larvae. These macroinvertebrates are highly sensitive to their environment, and their presence (or absence) can tell us a lot about the state of the river.The results? Based on initial identifications, the Cedar River shows signs of excellent water quality—making it one of Michigan’s prized Blue Ribbon Trout Streams.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20260203035515 +0000" stop="20260203040019 +0000"><title>Rivers are Life</title><desc>Dow employees, their family and friends, and Katie from Rivers are Life join the Ijams Nature Center for their 36th Annual River Rescue in Knoxville, TN.
