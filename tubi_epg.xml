Led by Cory Redwine, Conservation Director of Project SeaSafe, this is the 4th Annual Clean Water Collective and it’s bigger than ever. This time, we’re in Grant, Florida, where 4 million clams are being released into the Indian River Lagoon, paired with the planting of thousands of mangroves, oyster work by CCA and trash clean ups to help restore one of Florida’s most critical ecosystems. But it’s not just about hard work—it’s about connection. With local captains, fishing legends, and the Local Knowledge crew on hand, we hit the water to show why this place is worth fighting for. From clam drops by drone, to in-water mangrove planting, to monster snook catches, this is hands-on conservation at its best. This two-part series kicks off with action, heart, and the kind of hope only a healthy waterway can bring. Don’t miss Part 1—where conservation meets community and everyone gets their hands wet.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20251002190001 +0000" stop="20251002193001 +0000"><title>Winchester Life</title><desc>Nestled in the hills of Ohio just west of the Appalachians is a very special deer camp ripe with memories from deer season’s past.

When the post mortem confirms her death was no accident, the pair discover that nothing is what it seems to be within the little village as they try to find out what exactly she saw. Their investigation introduces Barnaby and Troy to many eccentric and quirky residents and soon turns up a web of sex, blackmail and lies, and the possibility that the murder could be connected to a shooting accident two years ago, which claimed another woman's life.</desc></programme><channel id="671073"><display-name>Unsolved Mysteries</display-name><icon

With each new robbery, the bandits perfected their craft, leaving behind no evidence and escaping with hundreds and thousands of dollars.  As the robbers became increasingly violent, pressure mounted to end their reign.  With few leads, the FBI forced their own luck.
