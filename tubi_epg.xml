Quiñones observes and comments on how ordinary people behave when they are confronted with dilemmas that require them either to take action or to walk by and mind their own business. Various scenarios are created that force people to make split-second -- and often surprising -- decisions, and variations of the situation (such as changing the genders, races or clothing of the people involved) are often featured to see if different reactions are elicited. Examples of situations on the show include a waitress being harassed by her boss, and a drunken valet trying to park cars.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20250823190000 +0000" stop="20250823200000 +0000"><title>Search for the Truth: The Amanda Knox Story</title><desc>Amanda Knox discusses the yearslong battle to prove her innocence after being wrongfully convicted of her roommate's 2007 murder; interviews with K.J.

With no experience with this kind of predator, Viennese police turned to the FBI. FBI profilers were able to identify a suspect in the murders.  More ominously, they linked this same killer to murders committed in the United States.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000091" start="20250823051000 +0000" stop="20250823060800 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>In the mid-1990's, a gang of professional bank robbers raided cities across seven states.
