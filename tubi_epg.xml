As a result, Yami Marik becomes angered, and attacks Odion with the Millennium Rod, which weakens Odion even more. Odion doesn't give up, despite Ishizu's protests. As Marik continues his onslaught (which begins to injure Odion), Odion tells Marik's good side that together, they had conquered his evil half before, and that they could do it again. Then, he tells the good Marik that since Yami Marik was created by the good Marik's hatred, he has the power to destroy him. As Yami Marik raises the Rod to deliver the final blow, the good Marik disappears from the field, and begins fighting against Yami Marik, who struggles for control over Marik's body, and refuses to be defeated. However, Marik's good half stalls Yami Marik long enough for Yugi to activate his spell card. Yugi's Ragnarok spell succeeds in destroying (and removing to the graveyard) Ra, allowing the good Marik to regain control of his body. However, a sliver of Yami Marik reappears on the field, although this time, he is the victim. Yami Marik tries to convince the good Marik to help him seize the Millennium Items and rule the world together, but fails as Marik has decided to stop being evil and make up for his actions. Marik surrenders the duel to Yugi, which sends Yami Marik to the Shadow Realm, ending the Battle City finals. Bakura and Mai are returned from the shadow realm and Marik is reunited with his siblings, who forgive him. Yugi receives the three Egyptian God Cards.

Because of a combination of threats, from pollution to climate change, the densely populated area’s fish populations are dwindling – but locals are educating themselves on ways to make change. In this beautifully photographed award-winning film, we get a rare glimpse into life on the lake while learning how a dedicated conservation group is combatting plastic pollution.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20260120034841 +0000" stop="20260120040012 +0000"><title>Rivers are Life</title><desc>Nathalie Lasselin is a diver, filmmaker and activist who has explored everything from the Arctic to underwater caves in China; yet this River Hero finds herself pulled back to the waters of her home, Montreal, to help clean up the St. Lawrence River.

When the post mortem confirms her death was no accident, the pair discover that nothing is what it seems to be within the little village as they try to find out what exactly she saw.

When Agnes's cousin, Esslyn Carmichael, inadvertently cuts his own throat during the final act, it's quickly discovered that the tape on the prop blade he had used was removed without anyone knowing.
