In Desert Ghost, Will Cooper heads west to Marathon, Texas, with longtime friend and mentor Cody Roberts to hunt aoudad in one of the most remote landscapes in the state. Rooted in family legacy, this film explores Cody’s deep ties to the desert, the story behind Desert Ghost Distillery, and the mystique of a western oasis near Big Bend National Park. More than a hunt, Desert Ghost dives into the role of aoudad management and its importance to desert bighorn sheep conservation efforts led by Texas Parks and Wildlife and the Wild Sheep Foundation. Sometimes, to protect what belongs here — you have to chase the ghosts. You really do have to be tough, determined, or one lucky bastard to make it out in West Texas.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20260215080016 +0000" stop="20260215083005 +0000"><title>Saltwater Experience</title><desc>Captains Tom Rowland and Rich Tudor are joined by Rich's son Reed, who takes the wheel and directs the team into some amazing early morning baby tarpon fishing in the Everglades.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20260215083005 +0000" stop="20260215090004 +0000"><title>saltwater experience</title><desc>Captains Tom Rowland and Rich Tudor take Hunter Smallback into the Everglades for some snook fishing, and the action really heats up when some hungry Lemon sharks crash the party.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20260215090004 +0000" stop="20260215093005 +0000"><title>saltwater experience</title><desc>Captains Tom Rowland and Rich Tudor catch two thirds of a slam when they bring Tom’s new Yellowfin 24’ Bay up to Key Largo for some exciting flats fishing.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20260215093005 +0000" stop="20260215100001 +0000"><title>Saltwater Experience</title><desc>Captains Tom Rowland and Rich Tudor are joined by Captain Mason Baker to sample some early morning Islamorada backcountry baby tarpon action.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20260215100001 +0000" stop="20260215103000 +0000"><title>Saltwater Experience</title><desc>After a successful morning of baby tarpon fishing, Captains Tom Rowland, Rich Tudor and Mason Baker slide over to the legendary downtown Islamorada flats to check on the resurgence of Florida Keys bonefish.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20260215103000 +0000" stop="20260215110000 +0000"><title>Saltwater Experience</title><desc>Captains Tom Rowland and Rich Tudor head into the Everglades backcountry out of Key Largo to fish the shallow grass flats for tailing redfish.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20260215110000 +0000" stop="20260215113001 +0000"><title>Reel Animals</title><desc>Long time friends Mike and Danny find a hot top water bite.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20260215113001 +0000" stop="20260215120001 +0000"><title>Sportsman's Journal</title><desc>When crappies move to shallow cover sometimes less means more!</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20260215120001 +0000" stop="20260215123001 +0000"><title>Captain's Log</title><desc>Captain Jonathan Moss explores the spartina creeks of St. Augustine, with the hopes of Landing a N.E.

More than a hunt, Desert Ghost dives into the role of aoudad management and its importance to desert bighorn sheep conservation efforts led by Texas Parks and Wildlife and the Wild Sheep Foundation.

Also present is disgraced ex-policeman Jack Colby, a former colleague of Barnaby's – but Jack refuses to talk to his old friend. When Jack is murdered, the detective must delve into the dark secrets in the victim's past. There are certainly dark secrets to uncover, and Barnaby has to determine whether the victim's part in a scandal years earlier at Causton police station, is key to the mystery behind his death. It isn't long before he finds that Eddie Marston is attempting blackmail, and soon murdered as a result, and that Lord Holm is in love with Jack's wife, psychotherapist Gina.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20260215090000 +0000" stop="20260215110000 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>It's a good day for the Hicks family, as the name of Tommy Hicks - who was executed during World War I for "cowardice and desertion" - is added to the list on Midsomer Parva's war memorial. Tommy's son Lionel and grandson Dave, mayor of Causton and whom Barnaby does not like (owing to dodgy building work by the mayor's company), are thrilled, but the snooty Hammonds are decidedly less pleased. Henry, the patriarch of the Hammond family, is particularly riled by his insalubrious neighbours, and has nurtured a long-running feud with the Hickses. But the evening after a battle re-enactment in the village, Henry is murdered - and Barnaby must delve into the history of the two families to find the killer, discovering a web of fraud, lies, and hidden truths.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20260215110000 +0000" stop="20260215120000 +0000"><title>Murdoch Mysteries</title><desc>Murdoch investigates the murder of a young opera singer.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20260215120000 +0000" stop="20260215130000 +0000"><title>Murdoch Mysteries</title><desc>The ambitious inventor of an electric vehicle.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20260215130000 +0000" stop="20260215140000 +0000"><title>Murdoch Mysteries</title><desc>Murdoch meets former lover Anna.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20260215140000 +0000" stop="20260215150000 +0000"><title>Murdoch Mysteries</title><desc>Murdoch investigates the murder of a shy librarian.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20260215150000 +0000" stop="20260215160000 +0000"><title>Murdoch Mysteries</title><desc>Murdoch teams up with Alexander Graham Bell when a ruthless inventor is killed by a rival.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20260215160000 +0000" stop="20260215170000 +0000"><title>Murdoch Mysteries</title><desc>A high stakes card game involving Dr. Grace ends in death.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20260215170000 +0000" stop="20260215180000 +0000"><title>Murdoch Mysteries</title><desc>Murdoch is taunted by a murderer who leaves dolls with personal messages at crime scenes.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20260215180000 +0000" stop="20260215190000 +0000"><title>Murdoch Mysteries</title><desc>The death of a Toronto hockey team captain.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20260215190000 +0000" stop="20260215200000 +0000"><title>Murdoch Mysteries</title><desc>Murdoch meets a man who says he can travel in time to prevent crimes.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20260215200000 +0000" stop="20260215210000 +0000"><title>Murdoch Mysteries</title><desc>Murdoch investigates the crash of a flying machine that killed a man, uncovering conspiracy and sabotage.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20260215210000 +0000" stop="20260215220000 +0000"><title>Magnum</title><desc>Magnum and Higgins must find Kumu when she's kidnapped by an injured man accused of killing his wife.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20260215220000 +0000" stop="20260215230000 +0000"><title>Magnum P.I.</title><desc>Magnum and Higgins go under cover as a couple on a romantic bus tour;
