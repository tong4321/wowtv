The chase was on, and Wilder ultimately lost.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000091" start="20260220185700 +0000" stop="20260220195700 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>On June 21, 1964, three civil rights workers, two white and one black disappeared in Mississippi while passing through Neshoba County. A massive FBI investigation led to the recovery of the bodies of the slain men and physical evidence was recovered and analyzed. The FBI labs confirmed that all but one of the bullets used to kill the men came from the same gun.   The FBI gained the trust of an informant, whose information led to the conviction of seven local Ku Klux Klan members.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000091" start="20260220195700 +0000" stop="20260220205400 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>In Alabama, a pair of convicted felons escaped the custody of a local deputy and fled across the country.  Eluding authorities, they moved from state to state in a wave of abduction and car theft.  When a foreign military officer disappeared along their trail, police and FBI agents wondered if the armed fugitives had become killers.  Agents believed the pair were growing more violent and raced to find the escapees before more victims crossed their path.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000091" start="20260220205400 +0000" stop="20260220215000 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>On Mississippi's Gulf Coast, a judge and his politician wife were brutally murdered in their home.  The killer left few clues and the investigation led nowhere.  But the FBI was patiently waiting in the wings.  Once it was determined that federal laws had been violated, they pounced on the investigation. They uncovered a corrupt local government and a group of violent criminal conspirators known as the Dixie Mafia, responsible for fraud, money laundering and murder.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000091" start="20260220215000 +0000" stop="20260220225000 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>The rapes and murders of ten women near Tampa, Florida in 1984 had the authorities puzzled and the community scared.   Since the beginning, the FBI had been analyzing the crime scene evidence and had found a common link: red trilobal carpet fibers.  But there was no suspect, until one of the killer's potential victims survived.  Through her interviews and the cooperation of local authorities and the FBI, 31-year-old Bobby Joe Long emerged as the prime suspect.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000091" start="20260220225000 +0000" stop="20260220234900 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>On the day before Thanksgiving, a mother discovered her 10 year-old son was missing from his school.

Lured by the easy wealth of the narcotics industry, crooked cops began breaking the laws they were sworn to uphold. They would stop at nothing, including murder, to protect their rackets. When it became clear they could no longer police themselves, the FBI got involved. Putting their lives on the line, undercover agents devised a way to flush out the violent cops and restore trust in the city's police force.</desc></programme><channel id="692086"><display-name>FilmRise True Crime</display-name><icon src="https://canvas-lb.tubitv.com/opts/6mXixL0-R07gAA==/83aa1731-c6a7-42d6-b797-1d2210b665ec/CHgQeDoFMS4xLjhAAQ==" /></channel><programme channel="692086" start="20260219023900 +0000" stop="20260219030700 +0000"><title>Forensic Files</title><desc>Witnesses, investigators, and medical experts discuss how forensic evidence was used to solve notable true crime cases in this long-running series.</desc></programme><programme channel="692086" start="20260219030700 +0000" stop="20260219033300 +0000"><title>Forensic Files</title><desc>Witnesses, investigators, and medical experts discuss how forensic evidence was used to solve notable true crime cases in this long-running series.</desc></programme><programme channel="692086" start="20260219033300 +0000" stop="20260219040200 +0000"><title>Forensic Files</title><desc>Witnesses, investigators, and medical experts discuss how forensic evidence was used to solve notable true crime cases in this long-running series.</desc></programme><programme channel="692086" start="20260219040200 +0000" stop="20260219045700 +0000"><title>Meet, Marry, Murder</title><desc>Wedded couples vow to stay together, until death do they part.
