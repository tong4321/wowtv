The lucky 12 that move through, battle it out with a giant toothbrush Sweeper. ‘Nat with the Tats’ and Renee ‘Lets get physical’ move through to the Dreadmill, flying the banner for the ladies.

Justin Leake and his cousin encounter when December turns unseasonably warm. It’s a grey morning with thick fog so Justin and Capt. Brent Berry won’t be heading offshore right away as planned. Instead, Justin turns to his Humminbird CoastMaster charts to pinpoint a near shore artificial reef just five minutes from the St. Andrews Pass, where the anglers will do a little fishing until the fog burns off. Capt. Leake opts to send a jig to the bottom and he’s not very picky about the one that gets tied on. “When fishing reefs, the specific jig doesn’t matter because it’s all about the presentation,” he says. “When you’re sitting on top of a wreck, break out the ‘junk jigs’ – they get bit just fine.” And that proves to be the case as Justin and Brent enjoy non-stop battles against amberjack, red snapper and bonita. And with a bite this good, there’s no reason to go anywhere else!

Instead, Justin turns to his Humminbird CoastMaster charts to pinpoint a near shore artificial reef just five minutes from the St. Andrews Pass, where the anglers will do a little fishing until the fog burns off. Capt. Leake opts to send a jig to the bottom and he’s not very picky about the one that gets tied on. “When fishing reefs, the specific jig doesn’t matter because it’s all about the presentation,” he says. “When you’re sitting on top of a wreck, break out the ‘junk jigs’ – they get bit just fine.” And that proves to be the case as Justin and Brent enjoy non-stop battles against amberjack, red snapper and bonita. And with a bite this good, there’s no reason to go anywhere else! Also, we take a look at the United States Coast Guard Auxiliary’s new paddle craft safety initiative.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20251104130000 +0000" stop="20251104133301 +0000"><title>Fly Shop Tour</title><desc>We kick off Season 2 in Tennessee where we stop in Nashville, Townsend, and Johnson City!!</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20251104133301 +0000" stop="20251104135958 +0000"><title>Fly Shop Tour</title><desc>This episode we make our way through the mountains of western North Carolina, where we stop in Asheville and Cashiers!!</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20251104135958 +0000" stop="20251104143000 +0000"><title>Fly Shop Tour</title><desc>This episode we make our way through Georgia, where we stop in Helen, Alpharetta and Atlanta!!</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20251104143000 +0000" stop="20251104150002 +0000"><title>Fly Shop Tour</title><desc>This episode we make our way through South Carolina, where we stop in Clemson, Travelers Rest and Charleston!!</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20251104150002 +0000" stop="20251104153000 +0000"><title>Goin' Coastal</title><desc>In this episode of Goin' Coastal, Captain Josh and Anna Calhoon set out for some fun Flounder fishing.

Henry, the patriarch of the Hammond family, is particularly riled by his insalubrious neighbours, and has nurtured a long-running feud with the Hickses.
