Confused, Detective Chief Inspector Barnaby and D.S. Jones can't work out whether it was a suicide pact or murder. Furthermore, they've got to find Miss Sharp and their investigation leads them to linking Simon and Laura with the villagers of Morton Fendle, who met at Elaine Trim's dancing classes. Eventually, the Barnaby family plus Jones make it to a 40s style dance night at the village hall before more villagers start turning up dead.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20250926090700 +0000" stop="20250926105500 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>When Faith Alexander arrives in Midsomer County to meet her long-lost uncle Rex Masters, she gets a shock - Rex's staff had been told that she was dead.

Barnaby and Jones are soon on the case, trying to establish who would have wanted the elderly man dead. Several people soon come forward with multiple wills, which confuse the matter, but when two more people, close friends of Rex, are also murdered, the investigation raises question on the motive, leading Barnaby to wonder if it was down to finances, passion, or something from Rex's past.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20250926105500 +0000" stop="20250926124600 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>Following the death of Alan King while on a business trip to China, the family company, King's Crystal, is in financial trouble.

In addition to strife between members of the family, the factory workers are outraged at the loss of their jobs.

During their opening performance, the band's singer, Mimi (Suzi Quatro), falls to the ground dead - electrocuted by a wire that had been run through the microphone stand. Barnaby and Jones soon find the rest of the band could be targets, and when another is killed, questions are raised as to whether former band member, Ginger Foxton, who went missing for 30 years and is presumed dead, is still at large.

Barnaby soon gets to work tracking down the killer, but it seems someone is trying to implicate the detective in the murder. And once he is replaced on the case, finding the culprit seems less likely than ever, as his replacement is more concerned of an upcoming wedding than the investigation.

There are certainly dark secrets to uncover, and Barnaby has to determine whether the victim's part in a scandal years earlier at Causton police station, is key to the mystery behind his death. It isn't long before he finds that Eddie Marston is attempting blackmail, and soon murdered as a result, and that Lord Holm is in love with Jack's wife, psychotherapist Gina.</desc></programme><channel id="671073"><display-name>Unsolved Mysteries</display-name><icon src="https://canvas-lb.tubitv.com/opts/5DVrF33Bfks10w==/864892f9-3ab0-4950-9f8b-189ec2d92c20/CHgQeDoFMS4xLjhAAQ==" /></channel><programme channel="671073" start="20250925120800 +0000" stop="20250925130800 +0000"><title>Misterios Sin Revolver</title><desc>Este episodio incluye: A Quemarropa, Hijo del Buscador, Actualización: Cacería de Brujas, El Golpe de Nashville y Testimonio Silencioso.</desc></programme><programme channel="671073" start="20250925130800 +0000" stop="20250925141000 +0000"><title>Misterios Sin Revolver</title><desc>Este episodio incluye: Asesinato en Fiesta de Navidad, Actualización: Fraude Nudista, Fraude Gitano, Dólares de Drummond &amp; Actualización y Recuperación de Coma.</desc></programme><programme channel="671073" start="20250925141000 +0000" stop="20250925151500 +0000"><title>Misterios Sin Revolver</title><desc>Este episodio incluye: Madre Desaparecida, Actualización: Personales, El Escape de San Quentin &amp; Actualización, Millones de Medford Partes 1 &amp; 2 &amp; Actualización y Asesino de Cartón &amp; Actualización</desc></programme><programme channel="671073" start="20250925151500 +0000" stop="20250925161600 +0000"><title>Misterios Sin Revolver</title><desc>Este episodio incluye: Casería de Brujas &amp; Actualización, Actualización: Amigos Hasta el Final, Tiempo Faltante Partes 1 &amp; 2 y Amnesia de Infarto &amp; Actualización.</desc></programme><programme channel="671073" start="20250925161600 +0000" stop="20250925171500 +0000"><title>Misterios Sin Revolver</title><desc>Este episodio incluye: Feriantes, Asesino de Policías de VA &amp; Actualización, Heredero de Red Lake &amp; Actualización, Leo Koury &amp; Actualización, Rapto de Hayward y El Fantasma de Tatum.</desc></programme><programme channel="671073" start="20250925171500 +0000" stop="20250925181700 +0000"><title>Misterios Sin Revolver</title><desc>Este episodio incluye: Policía del Vicio, Actualización: Flim Flam de Florida, ¿Dónde Está el Testigo? &amp; Actualización, Actualización: Muchas Gracias Philip, Jackie La Hermana Perdida &amp; Actualización y Ex Monje Perdido &amp; Actualización.</desc></programme><programme channel="671073" start="20250925181700 +0000" stop="20250925191600 +0000"><title>Misterios Sin Revolver</title><desc>Este episodio incluye: El Barco Fantasma Queen Mary, Actualización: Carlucci, Dos Strikes &amp; Actualización y Personales Pts. 1 &amp; 2 &amp; Actualización.</desc></programme><programme channel="671073" start="20250925191600 +0000" stop="20250925201500 +0000"><title>Misterios Sin Revolver</title><desc>Este episodio incluye: Autoestopista Misterioso, Fuera Anclas, Amor Perdido con Suerte &amp; Actualización y Abusador de Vegas &amp; Actualización.</desc></programme><programme channel="671073" start="20250925201500 +0000" stop="20250925211000 +0000"><title>Misterios Sin Revolver</title><desc>Este episodio incluye: El Fantasma de St. James, Atracción Fantasmal, ¿Dónde Está Ella Ahora?
