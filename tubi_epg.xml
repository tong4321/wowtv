Each team receives a surprise box with 16 different ingredients and one protein. They’ll have 60 minutes to prepare and present their dishes to the diners, who then will vote on their favorite dish. To kick off the challenge, judge Christina Tosi exhibits her signature three-layer cake for the contestants. Find out who bakes their way through the pressure and who melts down.</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20260102110000 +0000" stop="20260102120000 +0000"><title>Next Level Chef</title><desc>The competition gets spicy as contestants prepare a next level Italian dinner.</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20260102120000 +0000" stop="20260102130000 +0000"><title>Next Level Chef</title><desc>The contestants fly the coop as they prepare a next level poultry dish.</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20260102130000 +0000" stop="20260102140000 +0000"><title>Kitchen Nightmares - Censored</title><desc>Chef Ramsay lends a helping hand to an Italian restaurant in Philadelphia that is hampered by a weak menu and poor service.</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20260102140000 +0000" stop="20260102150000 +0000"><title>Kitchen Nightmares - Censored</title><desc>In the season four finale, Chef Ramsay finds a befuddled staff and disappointing service at Zocalo, an Italian eatery in Philadelphia.</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20260102150000 +0000" stop="20260102160000 +0000"><title>Hell's Kitchen</title><desc>It's game on for the chefs.</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20260102160000 +0000" stop="20260102170000 +0000"><title>Hell's Kitchen</title><desc>Good teams stick together.</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20260102170000 +0000" stop="20260102180000 +0000"><title>MasterChef</title><desc>The losing contestants from the Sweet 16 Challenge in last week’s episode are faced with the Birthday Cake pressure test and will have 90 minutes to bake a three-layer birthday cake.

The next morning, when Frances Kirby is out for her morning jog, she notices the vintage car they were in up at the airfield, containing Simon Bright's dead body, with Laura nowhere to be seen. Confused, Detective Chief Inspector Barnaby and D.S. Jones can't work out whether it was a suicide pact or murder. Furthermore, they've got to find Miss Sharp and their investigation leads them to linking Simon and Laura with the villagers of Morton Fendle, who met at Elaine Trim's dancing classes. Eventually, the Barnaby family plus Jones make it to a 40s style dance night at the village hall before more villagers start turning up dead.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20260103015900 +0000" stop="20260103034700 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>When Faith Alexander arrives in Midsomer County to meet her long-lost uncle Rex Masters, she gets a shock - Rex's staff had been told that she was dead. Things become even more complex when Rex's body is found in a nearby river, bearing wounds that suggest he was murdered. Barnaby and Jones are soon on the case, trying to establish who would have wanted the elderly man dead. Several people soon come forward with multiple wills, which confuse the matter, but when two more people, close friends of Rex, are also murdered, the investigation raises question on the motive, leading Barnaby to wonder if it was down to finances, passion, or something from Rex's past.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20260103034700 +0000" stop="20260103053700 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>Following the death of Alan King while on a business trip to China, the family company, King's Crystal, is in financial trouble. As plans to shut the Midsomer Magna factory are being put into action, Alan's wife Hilary and brother Charles are married in the village church - much to the dismay of Alan's son Ian. In addition to strife between members of the family, the factory workers are outraged at the loss of their jobs. So when company accountant Peter Baxter is found murdered, Barnaby and Jones suspect a disgruntled employee is to blame. But in order to investigate the matter further, Jones is forced to work undercover, and infiltrate the local group of Freemasons in the village.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20260103053700 +0000" stop="20260103072600 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>The music lovers of Midsomer County are delighted when a host of bands arrives for the Midsomer Rocks festival. Barnaby himself is particularly looking forward to seeing recently re-formed rock band, Hired Gun, perform on stage, but he soon gets close to the band for rather unfortunate reasons. During their opening performance, the band's singer, Mimi (Suzi Quatro), falls to the ground dead - electrocuted by a wire that had been run through the microphone stand. Barnaby and Jones soon find the rest of the band could be targets, and when another is killed, questions are raised as to whether former band member, Ginger Foxton, who went missing for 30 years and is presumed dead, is still at large. The detectives soon have to delve into a world of rock music, drug use and greed, to find the truth.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20260103072600 +0000" stop="20260103091400 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>The suspicious death of popular young GP Dr Alan Delaney brings Barnaby and Jones to Midsomer Market to investigate. The detectives are baffled as to a motive for murder - until they consider that the newly engaged Dr James Kirkwood may have been the intended victim. Before long, Barnaby and Jones are heading to Wales - former home to Delyth Mostyn, James's fiancee, to delve deeper into the mystery. There are certainly possible suspects in the murder and attempt on Kirkwood, from Delyth's children, who oppose the engagement, Delyth's husband, and more, as the detectives investigate things, in hopes of uncovering the truth before a major walk is to take place on Mount Snowdon.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20260103091400 +0000" stop="20260103110400 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>In the build-up to Luxton Deeping's annual photographic exhibition, a battle rages between the traditional and digital photographers of the pretty village. The dispute seems harmless enough - until Lionel Bell is found murdered in a nearby woodland, strangled with the cord of his light meter. Barnaby soon gets to work tracking down the killer, but it seems someone is trying to implicate the detective in the murder. And once he is replaced on the case, finding the culprit seems less likely than ever, as his replacement is more concerned of an upcoming wedding than the investigation. Barnaby is forced to work off the case to uncover who is framing him, and who wants dead other photographers in the village.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20260103110400 +0000" stop="20260103125300 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>The residents of Midsomer Magna are thrilled when a production crew arrives at the local manor house to film a version of The Scarlet Pimpernel.

But when the director, Nick Cheney, is found dead - his head severed by a prop guillotine - Barnaby must discover who would have wanted the victim dead. It soon becomes clear that things are not so simple, and the detectives soon have to shift through varying motives, layered by lies, hidden truths, and a possible robbery to be committed.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20260103125300 +0000" stop="20260103144300 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>Barnaby is in Midsomer Holm, bidding farewell to reformed criminal Ronnie Tyler, who has taken part in a rehabilitation scheme in the village.

When Jack is murdered, the detective must delve into the dark secrets in the victim's past. There are certainly dark secrets to uncover, and Barnaby has to determine whether the victim's part in a scandal years earlier at Causton police station, is key to the mystery behind his death. It isn't long before he finds that Eddie Marston is attempting blackmail, and soon murdered as a result, and that Lord Holm is in love with Jack's wife, psychotherapist Gina.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20260103144300 +0000" stop="20260103163000 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>The ghost village of Little Auburn has been abandoned since the war.
