This week we are forced to take notice of Demolition Dave, a 49 yr old South Australia man who thanks to some home training smashes the qualifier. For those lucky enough to survive the Fly Screen Sweeper it was Dizzy Dummy time. Emerging as the Dark Horse, Kobie Mulligan earned herself a shot in the Wipeout Zone, joined by a Strategist and Rubber Woman resulting in a bitter showdown.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20260126020300 +0000" stop="20260126025752 +0000"><title>Wipeout Australia</title><desc>From singing Pastors to Wookies, this week is jammed pack with Characters, who battle it out on the Qualifier with amusing attempts at the inconceivable Field Goal Swing. Its no easy task to earn a spot in the Wipeout Zone this week with the Dreadmill, sorting the men from the boys. Contestants must dodge the wrecking ball while shooting basketballs. Although there is one man who came prepared, Dodgeball Champion Dan Bennett, whose “Duck, Dive, Dip, Dodge and Dunk” training comes into play.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20260126025752 +0000" stop="20260126035141 +0000"><title>Wipeout Australia</title><desc>20 Greatest Hits</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20260126035141 +0000" stop="20260126044747 +0000"><title>Wipeout Australia</title><desc>Fashion comes to Wipeout Australia as we meet Adam “God’s Gift” Marshall, a self styled Ad man who conquers the Qualifier.

With reports of massive schools of redfish cruising the beaches, Monique (“Moe”) must decide whether to trust the intel and make a bold run down the coast—or rely on her own instincts built from years on the water. The mission is simple: put Rush on a true bull redfish and see if he has what it takes to earn a spot in her coveted “Over 40-Inch Club.” This trip highlights why Venice, Louisiana is considered one of the premier inshore fisheries in the country—and why having the right guide makes all the difference.
