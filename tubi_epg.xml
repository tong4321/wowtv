On the surface this place seems idyllic, an Irish family run restaurant in the heart of beautiful countryside. Owner MAURA runs the front of house and her son LENIN is the Head chef, but it's not "happy families". With her life savings on the line Maura is in big trouble. She constantly bickers with her son whilst the customers are forced to wait hours for their fluorescent crab stick paellas, and stodgy carbonaras from Oscars "bit of everything" menu.</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20251220190000 +0000" stop="20251220200000 +0000"><title>The F Word</title><desc>S01:E02 - Episode 2</desc></programme><programme
