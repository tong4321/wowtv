This week we are forced to take notice of Demolition Dave, a 49 yr old South Australia man who thanks to some home training smashes the qualifier. For those lucky enough to survive the Fly Screen Sweeper it was Dizzy Dummy time. Emerging as the Dark Horse, Kobie Mulligan earned herself a shot in the Wipeout Zone, joined by a Strategist and Rubber Woman resulting in a bitter showdown.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20250724110136 +0000" stop="20250724115551 +0000"><title>The Almost Impossible Gameshow</title><desc>Comedy duo The Rubber Bandits provide anarchic commentary and their own twisted, surreal take on the action.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20250724115551 +0000" stop="20250724125151 +0000"><title>Wipeout Canada</title><desc>Topple towers, Cookie Cutter, The Tails, Teeter Totters and Crazy Beams are among the over-the-top obstacles on this week’s episode.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20250724125151 +0000" stop="20250724140452 +0000"><title>Total Wipeout</title><desc>In this episode, contestants face different games like The Qualifier and The Sweeper.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20250724140452 +0000" stop="20250724145842 +0000"><title>Wipeout Australia</title><desc>20 Greatest Hits</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20250724145842 +0000" stop="20250724155308 +0000"><title>Wipeout Australia</title><desc>Showdowns don’t come more epic than this.

When the post mortem confirms her death was no accident, the pair discover that nothing is what it seems to be within the little village as they try to find out what exactly she saw.

When Agnes's cousin, Esslyn Carmichael, inadvertently cuts his own throat during the final act, it's quickly discovered that the tape on the prop blade he had used was removed without anyone knowing.
