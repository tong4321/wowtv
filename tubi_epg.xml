Roy: The Original Tiger Kings</title><desc>At the height of their fame, groundbreaking magicians Siegfried &amp; Roy were the highest-paid entertainers in Las Vegas history, globally renowned for blending magic with their astonishing killer-cat interactions. Millions of tickets were sold, billions of dollars were made, and tiger mania swept the nation. But life in the ultra-exotic world of Siegfried &amp; Roy may not have always been what it seemed, as the magicians lived by the art of illusion off stage as well-painstakingly crafting myths about their relationships with their tigers and even with each other. Then after building that empire based on smoke, mirrors and giant cats, Siegfried &amp; Roy's longstanding world of illusions was destroyed by one fateful onstage encounter with an angry tiger in front of a sold-out audience. That horrifying act of violence shocked the world, unleashed a torrent of wild conspiracy theories, and forever redefined the magicians' legacy.</desc></programme><programme channel="641290" start="20260122050200 +0000" stop="20260122055600 +0000"><title>John Wayne: Cowboys &amp; Demons</title><desc>John Wayne was an actor, a legend, and an embodiment of America itself; he also spent much of his life quietly tormented, desperately trying to measure up to the towering Hollywood persona he had crafted.</desc></programme><programme channel="641290" start="20260122055600 +0000" stop="20260122065000 +0000"><title>Clint Eastwood: Hollywood Outlaw</title><desc>Film clips and interviews with biographers and colleagues chart the prolific, six-decade career of maverick actor-director Clint Eastwood.</desc></programme><programme channel="641290" start="20260122065000 +0000" stop="20260122093000 +0000"><title>On Patrol: Live</title><desc>Clayton County, Ga. officers find drugs while searching a vehicle while officers in Monroe County, La. struggle with a suspect over a taser; Richland County, S.C. officers respond to an assault.</desc></programme><programme channel="641290" start="20260122093000 +0000" stop="20260122120900 +0000"><title>On Patrol: Live</title><desc>A Richland County, S.C. pursuit ends at the local jail while officers in Clayton County, Ga. search for a suspect that fled on foot; Officers in Daytona Beach, Fla. respond to a domestic dispute.</desc></programme><programme channel="641290" start="20260122120900 +0000" stop="20260122130400 +0000"><title>America's Most Wanted</title><desc>The search for America's most wanted fugitives continues.</desc></programme><programme channel="641290" start="20260122130400 +0000" stop="20260122135900 +0000"><title>America's Most Wanted</title><desc>The search for America's most wanted fugitives continues.</desc></programme><programme channel="641290" start="20260122135900 +0000" stop="20260122145400 +0000"><title>World's Worst Drivers</title><desc>Clips of the amazing, humorous and downright stupid things people do while driving.</desc></programme><programme channel="641290" start="20260122145400 +0000" stop="20260122154700 +0000"><title>World's Worst Drivers</title><desc>Clips of the amazing, humorous and downright stupid things people do while driving.</desc></programme><programme channel="641290" start="20260122154700 +0000" stop="20260122164000 +0000"><title>World's Worst Drivers</title><desc>Clips of the amazing, humorous and downright stupid things people do while driving.</desc></programme><programme channel="641290" start="20260122164000 +0000" stop="20260122170900 +0000"><title>Caught Red Handed</title><desc>Investigators expose a corrupt employee at a high-end electronics store in New York City.</desc></programme><programme channel="641290" start="20260122170900 +0000" stop="20260122173800 +0000"><title>Caught Red Handed</title><desc>A team of loss prevention specialists descend on a hipster hotspot in SoHo to match wits with scheming shoplifters.</desc></programme><programme channel="641290" start="20260122173800 +0000" stop="20260122180700 +0000"><title>Caught Red Handed</title><desc>Undercover investigators set a trap to catch a habitual shoplifter plaguing one of New York City's trendiest clothing stores.</desc></programme><programme channel="641290" start="20260122180700 +0000" stop="20260122183600 +0000"><title>Caught Red Handed</title><desc>Undercover specialists converge in Miami to rescue a massive home improvement store that's under siege by shoplifters.</desc></programme><programme channel="641290" start="20260122183600 +0000" stop="20260122190500 +0000"><title>Caught Red Handed</title><desc>Undercover agents are in South Beach where a surf shop is hit by a wave of shoplifters.</desc></programme><programme channel="641290" start="20260122190500 +0000" stop="20260122193500 +0000"><title>Caught Red Handed</title><desc>Shoplifters are wreaking havoc at a legendary record store in Ventura, Calif.</desc></programme><programme channel="641290" start="20260122193500 +0000" stop="20260122202900 +0000"><title>United 93: The Real Story</title><desc>The events on board the ill-fated United Airlines Flight 93; hijacked as part of the 9/11 attack, the terrorists were on a suicide mission to crash the plane into a Washington, D.C., target.</desc></programme><programme channel="641290" start="20260122202900 +0000" stop="20260122212300 +0000"><title>The Real Story Of...</title><desc>In 2014 the movie American Sniper was released.
