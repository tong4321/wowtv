and comments on how ordinary people behave when they are confronted with dilemmas that require them either to take action or to walk by and mind their own business. Various scenarios are created that force people to make split-second -- and often surprising -- decisions, and variations of the situation (such as changing the genders, races or clothing of the people involved) are often featured to see if different reactions are elicited. Examples of situations on the show include a waitress being harassed by her boss, and a drunken valet trying to park cars.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20251214090000 +0000" stop="20251214110000 +0000"><title>20/20</title><desc>Award-winning program anchored by David Muir, featuring unforgettable, character-driven true crime mysteries, exclusive newsmaker interviews, hard-hitting investigative reports and in-depth coverage of high profile stories.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20251214110000 +0000" stop="20251214113000 +0000"><title>ABC News Live Weekend</title><desc>Breaking news coverage and live video.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20251214113000 +0000" stop="20251214120000 +0000"><title>GMA Life</title><desc>A weekly roundup of the best lifestyle content from "Good Morning America";

A few early gobbles were heard in the distance, but the action didn't heat up until later in the morning when Tyler struck a couple birds close to the property line. They set up quickly, and in no time, turkeys were in their lap. A perfect shot by Colton and a quick switch of the Franchi was all it took. Two birds with one gun. The Georgia opening weekend was a success.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20251215150013 +0000" stop="20251215153000 +0000"><title>Blair Wiggins Outdoors</title><desc>Blair fishes the South Texas flats using artificial lures with Capt.

With its rugged coastline, fresh seafood straight from the Atlantic, and charming small towns, there's no place quite like it. In this episode of Flavor on the Fly, Ranga digs deep into his Sri Lankan roots to come up with a seafood curry dish like none other. Inspired by time spent with good friends, fly fishing for both smallmouth and striped bass, and harvesting local shellfish, this tour through the Pine Tree State results in a one-of-a-kind dish that gives cooking with local ingredients a whole new meaning.
