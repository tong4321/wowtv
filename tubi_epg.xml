Devoid of clams—which naturally filter the water—the lagoon’s water quality rapidly deteriorated as algae blooms went unchecked and sunlight could no longer reach the seagrass that is so vital to the lagoon’s ecosystem. 30 years later, a professor at the University of Florida teams up with a well-known deep sea fishing guide to launch the Indian River Clam Restoration Project. After scouring the lagoon and finding ONLY 39 surviving clams, Dr. Todd Osborne and Captain Blair Wiggins—with the help of local residents and businesses—begin carefully breeding “super clams" to restore the dwindling clam population in the Indian River Lagoon. “The Captain &amp; the Super Clams” is more than a human intervention success story; it’s a beautiful buddy film that shows the power of community, science, and technology coming together to find an innovative solution for bio-diversity protection.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20251031225123 +0000" stop="20251031230016 +0000"><title>Rivers are Life</title><desc>Dow employees, their family and friends, and Katie from Rivers are Life join the Ijams Nature Center for their 36th Annual River Rescue in Knoxville, TN.

Devoid of clams—which naturally filter the water—the lagoon’s water quality rapidly deteriorated as algae blooms went unchecked and sunlight could no longer reach the seagrass that is so vital to the lagoon’s ecosystem. 30 years later, a professor at the University of Florida teams up with a well-known deep sea fishing guide to launch the Indian River Clam Restoration Project. After scouring the lagoon and finding ONLY 39 surviving clams, Dr. Todd Osborne and Captain Blair Wiggins—with the help of local residents and businesses—begin carefully breeding “super clams" to restore the dwindling clam population in the Indian River Lagoon. “The Captain &amp; the Super Clams” is more than a human intervention success story; it’s a beautiful buddy film that shows the power of community, science, and technology coming together to find an innovative solution for bio-diversity protection.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20251031225123 +0000" stop="20251031230016 +0000"><title>Rivers are Life</title><desc>Dow employees, their family and friends, and Katie from Rivers are Life join the Ijams Nature Center for their 36th Annual River Rescue in Knoxville, TN.
