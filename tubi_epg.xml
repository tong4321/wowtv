that require them either to take action or to walk by and mind their own business. Various scenarios are created that force people to make split-second -- and often surprising -- decisions, and variations of the situation (such as changing the genders, races or clothing of the people involved) are often featured to see if different reactions are elicited. Examples of situations on the show include a waitress being harassed by her boss, and a drunken valet trying to park cars.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20260221200000 +0000" stop="20260221210000 +0000"><title>John and Carolyn: Love, Beauty and Loss</title><desc>Love, ambition and legacy collide under an unrelenting public spotlight throughout John F.

have too much baggage." How much is acceptable among three contestants in each episode is determined by the "dater," who hears the candidates' intimate secrets and hidden flaws, as well as their attempts to deflect these traits by describing their positive attributes. After two elimination rounds leave one remaining contestant, it's the dater's turn to reveal his or her own baggage ... and then the contestant decides to go forward with the date or not.

In Desert Ghost, Will Cooper heads west to Marathon, Texas, with longtime friend and mentor Cody Roberts to hunt aoudad in one of the most remote landscapes in the state.

More than a hunt, Desert Ghost dives into the role of aoudad management and its importance to desert bighorn sheep conservation efforts led by Texas Parks and Wildlife and the Wild Sheep Foundation. Sometimes, to protect what belongs here — you have to chase the ghosts. You really do have to be tough, determined, or one lucky bastard to make it out in West Texas.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20260220180000 +0000" stop="20260220183001 +0000"><title>HuntStand Presents</title><desc>For decades, Paul Butski has set the standard in turkey calling.

In this episode of DIRT, the crew goes full circle—meeting Muttonbird chefs Emma and George on the South Island before hopping up to Raglan and working their way back down. Water skiing next to snow-capped mountains, cooking in hot springs the Māori way, and stargazing at Wairarapa Dark Sky Reserve are all on the itinerary. But it’s the final “Feed” done Kiwi-style that makes one thing clear—in this unique and stunning land, nobody’s a stranger for long.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20260220195350 +0000" stop="20260220200020 +0000"><title>Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation</title><desc>“Part of our responsibility as citizens in this country is to make sure we not only take care of these resources but we hand it off to the next generation in better condition that we found it.” -Bob Ziehmer, Senior Director of Conservation for Bass Pro Shops &amp; Cabela's Join Bob in New Mexico as he talks about taking care of our natural resources for future generations.
