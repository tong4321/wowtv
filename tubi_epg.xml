Various scenarios are created that force people to make split-second -- and often surprising -- decisions, and variations of the situation (such as changing the genders, races or clothing of the people involved) are often featured to see if different reactions are elicited. Examples of situations on the show include a waitress being harassed by her boss, and a drunken valet trying to park cars.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20250824050000 +0000" stop="20250824070000 +0000"><title>20/20</title><desc>Award-winning program anchored by David Muir, featuring unforgettable, character-driven true crime mysteries, exclusive newsmaker interviews, hard-hitting investigative reports and in-depth coverage of high profile stories.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20250824070000 +0000" stop="20250824080000 +0000"><title>Search for the Truth: The Amanda Knox Story</title><desc>Amanda Knox discusses the yearslong battle to prove her innocence after being wrongfully convicted of her roommate's 2007 murder; interviews with K.J.

Furthermore, they've got to find Miss Sharp and their investigation leads them to linking Simon and Laura with the villagers of Morton Fendle, who met at Elaine Trim's dancing classes. Eventually, the Barnaby family plus Jones make it to a 40s style dance night at the village hall before more villagers start turning up dead.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20250825200800 +0000" stop="20250825215700 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>When Faith Alexander arrives in Midsomer County to meet her long-lost uncle Rex Masters, she gets a shock - Rex's staff had been told that she was dead. Things become even more complex when Rex's body is found in a nearby river, bearing wounds that suggest he was murdered. Barnaby and Jones are soon on the case, trying to establish who would have wanted the elderly man dead. Several people soon come forward with multiple wills, which confuse the matter, but when two more people, close friends of Rex, are also murdered, the investigation raises question on the motive, leading Barnaby to wonder if it was down to finances, passion, or something from Rex's past.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20250825215700 +0000" stop="20250825234700 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>Following the death of Alan King while on a business trip to China, the family company, King's Crystal, is in financial trouble. As plans to shut the Midsomer Magna factory are being put into action, Alan's wife Hilary and brother Charles are married in the village church - much to the dismay of Alan's son Ian. In addition to strife between members of the family, the factory workers are outraged at the loss of their jobs. So when company accountant Peter Baxter is found murdered, Barnaby and Jones suspect a disgruntled employee is to blame. But in order to investigate the matter further, Jones is forced to work undercover, and infiltrate the local group of Freemasons in the village.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20250825234700 +0000" stop="20250826013500 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>The music lovers of Midsomer County are delighted when a host of bands arrives for the Midsomer Rocks festival. Barnaby himself is particularly looking forward to seeing recently re-formed rock band, Hired Gun, perform on stage, but he soon gets close to the band for rather unfortunate reasons. During their opening performance, the band's singer, Mimi (Suzi Quatro), falls to the ground dead - electrocuted by a wire that had been run through the microphone stand. Barnaby and Jones soon find the rest of the band could be targets, and when another is killed, questions are raised as to whether former band member, Ginger Foxton, who went missing for 30 years and is presumed dead, is still at large. The detectives soon have to delve into a world of rock music, drug use and greed, to find the truth.</desc></programme><channel id="671073"><display-name>Unsolved Mysteries</display-name><icon src="https://canvas-lb.tubitv.com/opts/5DVrF33Bfks10w==/864892f9-3ab0-4950-9f8b-189ec2d92c20/CHgQeDoFMS4xLjhAAQ==" /></channel><programme channel="671073" start="20250824020200 +0000" stop="20250824025800 +0000"><title>Unsolved Mysteries With Robert Stack</title><desc>This episode includes: Forklift Mystery &amp; UD, Unicorn's Secret &amp; UD, Where's Jim?, Ohio Video Robbery and Grace's Ghost.</desc></programme><programme channel="671073" start="20250824025800 +0000" stop="20250824035400 +0000"><title>Unsolved Mysteries With Robert Stack</title><desc>Two Mary Morris Murders; Lenny Dirickson; Fatal Flowers and update; Boston Healer.</desc></programme><programme channel="671073" start="20250824035400 +0000" stop="20250824044700 +0000"><title>Unsolved Mysteries With Robert Stack</title><desc>Wood I Lie to You?; Wanted Weaver and update; What Happened to Natasha?

Shortly before leaving their hotel they mention they haven't been able to find what they're looking for; "something old and derelict that they can do up." Anne Merrick tells them about Winyard, a tumbledown cottage in the woods, might be for sale. At the estate agents they are told the house is not yet available for viewing. Later that evening they find the house on their own. However, Caroline has read up on the cottage's haunted reputation and only reluctantly explores it with Peter. The next morning they are found strangled in their own car. DCI Barnaby starts the investigation with the help of PC Ben Jones and they come across the world of estate agents, identical twins, ghosts, piano wire, and more before another body turns up.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20250825080000 +0000" stop="20250825100000 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>Villagers of Midsomer Barton are all set to celebrate Oak Apple Week, especially as the carnival queen event is set to return after an eight year absence.
