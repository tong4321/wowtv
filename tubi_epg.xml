progression of one of the most transcending documentaries ever created. It delves into the spiritual relevance of todays day and age at even furher levels. A feature length film created to help inspire everyday people through real life parables and narrations from recognizable spiritual figureheads. Presented as a series of short vignettes recorded in an intimate, close-cropped setting to engage the viewer as if he or she is soul seeking wisdom at the foot of a sage. Weaving the journey and anecdotes of some of the most prolific high profile ministers, evangelists and church leaders of the 21st Century, The Scroll took three years to complete, interviewing over 50 of the U.S.'s most progressive and revered Spiritual Leaders.</desc></programme><programme channel="692087" start="20250928203300 +0000" stop="20250928221800 +0000"><title>Cleaver Family Reunion</title><desc>This year, the delightfully dysfunctional Cleaver family will settle their differences once and for all... with a few misadventures along the way.</desc></programme><programme channel="692087" start="20250928221800 +0000" stop="20250929001100 +0000"><title>The Best Thing!</title><desc>A restaurateur discovers his deceased ex-girlfriend may have had his child.</desc></programme><channel id="400000004"><display-name>Revolt Mixtape</display-name><icon src="https://canvas-lb.tubitv.com/opts/4B20EMNDD-lyNA==/42481df4-a22f-4a86-90db-db1f96840422/CHgQeDoFMS4xLjhAAQ==" /></channel><programme channel="400000004" start="20250927010000 +0000" stop="20250927020000 +0000"><title>The Fat Joe Show</title><desc>Busta Rhymes joins Fat Joe to discuss his reason for getting back in shape, the making of Put Your Hand Wh...</desc></programme><programme channel="400000004" start="20250927020000 +0000" stop="20250927030000 +0000"><title>The Fat Joe Show</title><desc>J Prince joins Fat Joe to discuss his motivation behind starting Rap-A-Lot Records, his relationship with ...</desc></programme><programme channel="400000004" start="20250927030000 +0000" stop="20250927040000 +0000"><title>The Fat Joe Show</title><desc>Salaam Remi joins Fat Joe to discuss producing Nas's "Made You Look", explains the story behind Fat Joe pa...</desc></programme><programme channel="400000004" start="20250927040000 +0000" stop="20250927064500 +0000"><title>Drink Champs</title><desc>The episode we've been waiting for...
