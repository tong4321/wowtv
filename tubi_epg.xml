Justin Leake and his cousin encounter when December turns unseasonably warm. It’s a grey morning with thick fog so Justin and Capt. Brent Berry won’t be heading offshore right away as planned. Instead, Justin turns to his Humminbird CoastMaster charts to pinpoint a near shore artificial reef just five minutes from the St. Andrews Pass, where the anglers will do a little fishing until the fog burns off. Capt. Leake opts to send a jig to the bottom and he’s not very picky about the one that gets tied on. “When fishing reefs, the specific jig doesn’t matter because it’s all about the presentation,” he says. “When you’re sitting on top of a wreck, break out the ‘junk jigs’ – they get bit just fine.” And that proves to be the case as Justin and Brent enjoy non-stop battles against amberjack, red snapper and bonita. And with a bite this good, there’s no reason to go anywhere else! Also, we take a look at the United States Coast Guard Auxiliary’s new paddle craft safety initiative.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20260207230003 +0000" stop="20260207233000 +0000"><title>Winchester Life</title><desc>Overview: The mission of Shoot United is to be a content resource for millions of shooters and a place where people can learn, build confidence and find ways to participate.

Justin Leake and his cousin encounter when December turns unseasonably warm. It’s a grey morning with thick fog so Justin and Capt. Brent Berry won’t be heading offshore right away as planned. Instead, Justin turns to his Humminbird CoastMaster charts to pinpoint a near shore artificial reef just five minutes from the St. Andrews Pass, where the anglers will do a little fishing until the fog burns off. Capt. Leake opts to send a jig to the bottom and he’s not very picky about the one that gets tied on. “When fishing reefs, the specific jig doesn’t matter because it’s all about the presentation,” he says. “When you’re sitting on top of a wreck, break out the ‘junk jigs’ – they get bit just fine.” And that proves to be the case as Justin and Brent enjoy non-stop battles against amberjack, red snapper and bonita. And with a bite this good, there’s no reason to go anywhere else! Also, we take a look at the United States Coast Guard Auxiliary’s new paddle craft safety initiative.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20260207230003 +0000" stop="20260207233000 +0000"><title>Winchester Life</title><desc>Overview: The mission of Shoot United is to be a content resource for millions of shooters and a place where people can learn, build confidence and find ways to participate.

arms and divided, over the building of a supermarket. Things soon come to a head when independent environmental supervisor, Frank Hopkirk, is found stabbed to death at a Jubb's Timber Yard, the site of the new supermarket, by a pair of children. When Barnaby and Jones investigate to determine who wanted Hopkirk dead, they find out that he secretly came to the village under various aliases for sexual rendezvous with various women in fantasy role-playing scenarios, and that he had been making further investigations on the future development site and having doubts over claims it was contaminated. Either someone didn't like his investigations, or someone didn't like his sexual appetite, but either way, Barnaby finds himself investigating lies and more to uncover the truth.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20260208090000 +0000" stop="20260208110000 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>A few months ago, Annie Woodrow was arrested, accused of murdering her friend, Frances Trevelyan, on the motive of wanting Frances' husband. Her time in court has come, but DCI Barnaby is certain she still is holding things back in regards to the murder, and decides to monitor the trial. Yet a chance remark by Frances' youngest daughter, and a meeting with an old friend and psychiatrist, makes him begin to doubt the evidence for her conviction. Soon he and DC Jones, awaiting news of his promotion to DS, find themselves reinvestigating the case, and it soon becomes clear that they may have missed details that could implicate another in the murder.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20260208110000 +0000" stop="20260208120000 +0000"><title>Murdoch Mysteries</title><desc>A telephone operator and amateur sleuth hears a woman being strangled on the line.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20260208120000 +0000" stop="20260208130000 +0000"><title>Murdoch Mysteries</title><desc>Murdoch's ex-lover Anna visits Toronto on her way to be married but her fiance vanishes.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20260208130000 +0000" stop="20260208140000 +0000"><title>Murdoch Mysteries</title><desc>Probing a priest's murder Murdoch learns his long-lost sister is now a nun who claims a demon caused the death.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20260208140000 +0000" stop="20260208150000 +0000"><title>Murdoch Mysteries</title><desc>Murdoch hunts for a vampire, as rumors of vampirism spread across Toronto.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20260208150000 +0000" stop="20260208160000 +0000"><title>Murdoch Mysteries</title><desc>Murdoch is put on the case when a masked man is robbing banks and kissing the tellers before escaping.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20260208160000 +0000" stop="20260208170000 +0000"><title>Murdoch Mysteries</title><desc>A woman is murdered at an "Alice in Wonderland" party.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20260208170000 +0000" stop="20260208180000 +0000"><title>Murdoch Mysteries</title><desc>On suspension for interfering in an investigation and on the run for surreptitiously freeing a murderer to make amends, Murdoch leaves Toronto.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20260208180000 +0000" stop="20260208190000 +0000"><title>Murdoch Mysteries</title><desc>Murdoch pursues a Catholic suspect in the attempted assassination of the city's Protestant Mayor.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20260208190000 +0000" stop="20260208200000 +0000"><title>Murdoch Mysteries</title><desc>When Murdoch probes deaths linked to Egyptian antiquities, Crabtree is convinced a curse is to blame.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20260208200000 +0000" stop="20260208210000 +0000"><title>Murdoch Mysteries</title><desc>Murdoch infiltrates an anarchist group lead by activist Emma Goldman.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20260208210000 +0000" stop="20260208220000 +0000"><title>Magnum</title><desc>On Halloween, Magnum and Jin search for a skip tracer at a Halloween bash, while Katsumoto tracks an escaped killer who is headed to that same party; Higgins and Rick must spend the night at an allegedly haunted house to debunk it.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20260208220000 +0000" stop="20260208230000 +0000"><title>Magnum</title><desc>Magnum must help his defense attorney girlfriend when she realizes a client she successfully defended in a murder trial is actually guilty; TC confronts Kamekona about stealing his helicopter business.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20260208230000 +0000" stop="20260209000000 +0000"><title>Magnum</title><desc>Magnum investigates the death of a hotel guest who was thrown from her room's balcony while working on a secret investigation of her own; Icepick is released from jail and is trying to keep a secret from Rick.</desc></programme><channel id="715943"><display-name>Watchlist</display-name><icon src="https://canvas-lb.tubitv.com/opts/zi--5VQF6X4ojQ==/3f255caf-ac21-456a-add4-31745babe3cb/CHgQeDoFMS4xLjhAAQ==" /></channel><programme channel="715943" start="20260207195051 +0000" stop="20260207203516 +0000"><title>Invasion</title><desc>Russell and Underlay attempt to thwart Szura.</desc></programme><programme channel="715943" start="20260207203516 +0000" stop="20260207211801 +0000"><title>Invasion</title><desc>Underlay and Russell plan a rescue as hybrids gather humans.</desc></programme><programme channel="715943" start="20260207211801 +0000" stop="20260207220220 +0000"><title>Nikita</title><desc>Nikita decides it's time for Alex to leave Division.</desc></programme><programme channel="715943" start="20260207220220 +0000" stop="20260207224803 +0000"><title>Nikita</title><desc>Nikita gets a glimpse of how life could be without Division.</desc></programme><programme channel="715943" start="20260207224803 +0000" stop="20260207233217 +0000"><title>Nikita</title><desc>Percy turns on Alex.
