Pro Wrestler Mikey takes on Wipeout Australias very own Tom Cruise. Its neck and neck through the qualifier which this week includes a real Mission Impossible, Dirty Balls. The trash talk is as fierce as the competition and continues to the Wipeout Zone with the winner taking not only the $20,000 but also the glory. Australia is also introduced to a new kind of “violent love”, the Fight Hug.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20250713114258 +0000" stop="20250713123816 +0000"><title>Wipeout Australia</title><desc>This week contestants on Wipeout Australia are bought undone by a seemingly simple obstacle on the Qualifier, the Slippery Stairs.
