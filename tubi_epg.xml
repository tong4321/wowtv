A casting platform and floor would be cool…maybe a paint job.And Jay, well his gear is pretty shot, and his normally ripped physique has been obscured under some COVID poundage he acquired over the past year or so…And maybe a pedicure and haircut are in order before stepping in front of the camera…First, the bus. A little interior decorating perhaps. The 14 seats built for preschoolers don’t quite accommodate over-sized fishing dudes. And, come to find out, there are no rod racks. No bar. No stereo. No beds. No fly-tying stations. And no beer fridge.

Second only to Alaska in size, Texas is known as the place where everything is bigger. From big college football games to endless oil fields and vast wind farms, Texas is home to more than 30 million Americans. But the state is about more than just big oil, college football and cattle farms - it's also home to some of the best boating in the country. Boasting a myriad of waterways, boaters here enjoy hundreds of lakes, rivers and streams that provide recreational opportunities, abundant wildlife and plenty of fishing. From Austin Texas to San Antonio host Ryan McVinney and the Boat Trader crew explore the laid-back Texas lake life including boat up restaurants along the Colorado River, watersports in Austin and the history of the waterways throughout the region. Boat manufacturers highlighted in this episode are Tige Boats and ATX Surf Boats, two premium Texas-based wake boat brands known for their high-quality, cutting-edge vessels that come equipped with advanced wake shaping technologies and equipment ideal for water skiing, wake surfing and wakeboarding.

But then a new group appeared, more violent and aggressive than their predecessors.  All agents had to go on was a series of chilling phone calls, a mysterious voice, and the threat of more violence.  FBI field offices from New York to Miami coordinated their efforts, determined to catch the vicious killers.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000091" start="20250903175100 +0000" stop="20250903185000 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>A California bank manager panics and calls in the FBI after the door to his vault refuses to open.  Upon inspection, the vault has been blasted into from the ceiling, and over $2 million in valuables is gone.
