We developed our last farm, and did a 1031 tax free exchange to buy this farm so we can develop and sell it later on. This is the first time we’ve seen the property, so we are finding out what we are going to do with it and how we are going to lay it out. Once we get that figured out, we go into the dirty work of planting, moving box stands, and making sure everything is good for hunting season. Fast forward and we have two amazing hunts where both Ryan and myself take awesome bucks with our bows. This one has it all!

The project supports sturgeon population recovery through egg collection, hatchery programs, and community events like Port Huron’s Sturgeon Fest, organized by the Friends of the St. Clair River. Every year since its inception in 2012, Sturgeon Fest has released young sturgeon back into the wild, contributing to the unique species' resurgence in the Great Lakes region.

The project supports sturgeon population recovery through egg collection, hatchery programs, and community events like Port Huron’s Sturgeon Fest, organized by the Friends of the St. Clair River. Every year since its inception in 2012, Sturgeon Fest has released young sturgeon back into the wild, contributing to the unique species' resurgence in the Great Lakes region. This year, the Rivers are Life team helped tag two juvenile sturgeons, which made their debut in the popular festival's touch tank before release.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20250919030021 +0000" stop="20250919033016 +0000"><title>Modern Hunter</title><desc>After two years of dedicated practice with his bow, Producer, Ian heads out to the blind to try and get his very first whitetail deer.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20250919033016 +0000" stop="20250919040015 +0000"><title>Louisiana Catch and Cook</title><desc>Louisiana’s Cajun Ninja joins Chef Jay Ducote in our latest catch-and-cook adventure.
