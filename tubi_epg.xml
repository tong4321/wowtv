Various scenarios are created that force people to make split-second -- and often surprising -- decisions, and variations of the situation (such as changing the genders, races or clothing of the people involved) are often featured to see if different reactions are elicited. Examples of situations on the show include a waitress being harassed by her boss, and a drunken valet trying to park cars.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20250811030000 +0000" stop="20250811033000 +0000"><title>ABC World News Tonight With David Muir</title><desc>The latest news from America, as reported by the ABC television network.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20250811033000 +0000" stop="20250811040000 +0000"><title>ABC World News Tonight With David Muir</title><desc>The latest news from America, as reported by the ABC television network.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20250811040000 +0000" stop="20250811060000 +0000"><title>20/20</title><desc>Award-winning program anchored by David Muir, featuring unforgettable, character-driven true crime mysteries, exclusive newsmaker interviews, hard-hitting investigative reports and in-depth coverage of high profile stories.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20250811060000 +0000" stop="20250811063000 +0000"><title>ABC World News Now</title><desc>Up-to-date information on current events and news from around the world, airing in the overnight hours.

Although Barnaby and Troy are called in to deal with the theft and later dissuade him from forcefully evicting the travellers from the village, they soon have a murder on their hands, when a short while later Bridges is killed with his own shotgun. It quickly transpires that many in the village had hated the magistrate, who lied, bullied, and committed many an injustice, leaving the detectives determined to find who among them had pulled the trigger after Bridges pushed them past their breaking point.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20250811062600 +0000" stop="20250811082500 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>The double murder of eccentric widow, Isobel Hewitt, and adulterous doctor, Duncan Goff, lead Barnaby and Troy into finding out more about their personal and private lives in the village of Malham Bridge. While Troy suspects an antique dealer that Isobel befriended is the culprit, Barnaby is not convinced, believing anyone the victims knew when they were alive could have been the murderer, from the doctor's wife to the local owner of a restaurant. Even Isobel's close family and members of a local fly fishing group are suspects as they investigate all possible angles.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20250811082500 +0000" stop="20250811102300 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>When Martin Wroath is found dead in his home in Midsomer Worthy, Barnaby is unconvinced that he committed suicide with his own shotgun in an unnecessarily complex fashion.

Just as Barnaby begins to learn that Ruth was not all she seemed to be, officers of the NIS pull him off the case. While Troy is allowed to assist them, Barnaby is left handling a local operation into a spate of thefts, yet he decides to continue his investigations in secret. In doing so, he soon turns up armed robbery, unaccounted stolen money, former criminals, and secret liaisons, before discovering that the NIS investigation is not being as thorough as it should be.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20250811122200 +0000" stop="20250811141800 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>At his family home in Upper Warden, arrogant actor Larry Smith is killed, when a summer house he walks in to as part of a promotion for the sequel to his hit film, The House of Satan, is suddenly destroyed in an explosion.

While there was evidence he was desperately seeking to avoid bankruptcy, and had visited a local millionaire to get back his money from a scheme he had invested in, a post mortem reveals that he had been murdered. The two detectives soon find their investigations crossing over, when a man found to have an illegal collection of bird eggs, is also murdered, prompting concerns that the millionaire's scheme is being used to defraud many, and that someone is willing to kill to keep the scheme going.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20250811161500 +0000" stop="20250811180200 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>No one could suspect that a prestigious golf club would be the setting for murder, but when one of the major members is found dead, bludgeoned to death in a thicket next to the 13th hole, Barnaby and Jones try to determine what made him leave the fairway.
