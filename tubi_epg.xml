The contestant, known as the One, competes with a mob of 100 other players by answering questions. When the One answers correctly, each member of the mob that answered incorrectly is eliminated. The One earns money for each mob member who is eliminated. If the One can eliminate the entire mob, he wins $50,000. But if the One gets a question wrong, he is eliminated and the remaining mob members split his winnings.</desc></programme><programme channel="673411" start="20251105151700 +0000" stop="20251105154300 +0000"><title>Tug of Words</title><desc>Based on the playground game Tug-O-War, teams of two compete to answer word-clue questions correctly and pull the flag on the tug of war rope to their side.</desc></programme><programme channel="673411" start="20251105154300 +0000" stop="20251105160800 +0000"><title>Tug of Words</title><desc>Based on the playground game Tug-O-War, teams of two compete to answer word-clue questions correctly and pull the flag on the tug of war rope to their side.</desc></programme><programme channel="673411" start="20251105160800 +0000" stop="20251105163400 +0000"><title>Family Feud</title><desc>Steve Harvey assumes the hosting duties for this daytime game show in which five members of one family are pitted against five members of another family.

It’s all in the name really, an innocent set of stairs, covered in Wipeout Crash cream. Its up the way and down the way for all and sundry. The lucky 12 that move through, battle it out with a giant toothbrush Sweeper. ‘Nat with the Tats’ and Renee ‘Lets get physical’ move through to the Dreadmill, flying the banner for the ladies. Look out for Scotty Six Toes at the Big Balls and get the ear plugs ready as you meet Herr Chris. It’s a colourful week with leotards, laughs and lots of ladies.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20251104154558 +0000" stop="20251104164138 +0000"><title>Wipeout Australia</title><desc>Wipeout Australia debunks the myth that only young, fit and funky people should go on game shows. This week we are forced to take notice of Demolition Dave, a 49 yr old South Australia man who thanks to some home training smashes the qualifier. For those lucky enough to survive the Fly Screen Sweeper it was Dizzy Dummy time. Emerging as the Dark Horse, Kobie Mulligan earned herself a shot in the Wipeout Zone, joined by a Strategist and Rubber Woman resulting in a bitter showdown.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20251104164138 +0000" stop="20251104175654 +0000"><title>101 Ways to Leave a Gameshow</title><desc>Steve Jones hosts the series where contestants are ejected in the most nerve-wracking means ever seen on TV.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20251104175654 +0000" stop="20251104185300 +0000"><title>Wipeout Australia</title><desc>Fashion comes to Wipeout Australia as we meet Adam “God’s Gift” Marshall, a self styled Ad man who conquers the Qualifier.

Justin Leake and his cousin encounter when December turns unseasonably warm. It’s a grey morning with thick fog so Justin and Capt. Brent Berry won’t be heading offshore right away as planned. Instead, Justin turns to his Humminbird CoastMaster charts to pinpoint a near shore artificial reef just five minutes from the St. Andrews Pass, where the anglers will do a little fishing until the fog burns off. Capt. Leake opts to send a jig to the bottom and he’s not very picky about the one that gets tied on. “When fishing reefs, the specific jig doesn’t matter because it’s all about the presentation,” he says. “When you’re sitting on top of a wreck, break out the ‘junk jigs’ – they get bit just fine.” And that proves to be the case as Justin and Brent enjoy non-stop battles against amberjack, red snapper and bonita. And with a bite this good, there’s no reason to go anywhere else!
