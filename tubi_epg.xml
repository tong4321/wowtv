Various scenarios are created that force people to make split-second -- and often surprising -- decisions, and variations of the situation (such as changing the genders, races or clothing of the people involved) are often featured to see if different reactions are elicited. Examples of situations on the show include a waitress being harassed by her boss, and a drunken valet trying to park cars.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20260207200000 +0000" stop="20260207210000 +0000"><title>The Turpins: A New House of Horror -- A Diane Sawyer Special Event</title><desc>Three of the youngest Turpin siblings tell their stories of the past and how they experienced abuse a second time in the foster care system.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20260207210000 +0000" stop="20260207213000 +0000"><title>ABC News Live Weekend: Saturday</title><desc>Breaking news coverage and live video.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20260207213000 +0000" stop="20260207220000 +0000"><title>AI: The Next Chapter</title><desc>ABC News Live Special Programming.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20260207220000 +0000" stop="20260207223000 +0000"><title>ABC News Live Weekend: Saturday</title><desc>Breaking news coverage and live video.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20260207223000 +0000" stop="20260207230000 +0000"><title>All Access With Linsey Davis</title><desc>A 30-minute interview franchise of ABC News Live "Prime With Linsey Davis" featuring candid conversations with celebrities, musicians, and newsmakers from across the cultural landscape.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20260207230000 +0000" stop="20260208010000 +0000"><title>20/20</title><desc>Award-winning program anchored by David Muir, featuring unforgettable, character-driven true crime mysteries, exclusive newsmaker interviews, hard-hitting investigative reports and in-depth coverage of high profile stories.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20260208010000 +0000" stop="20260208030000 +0000"><title>20/20</title><desc>Award-winning program anchored by David Muir, featuring unforgettable, character-driven true crime mysteries, exclusive newsmaker interviews, hard-hitting investigative reports and in-depth coverage of high profile stories.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20260208030000 +0000" stop="20260208040000 +0000"><title>Dirty Talk: When Daytime Talk Shows Ruled TV</title><desc>Soap operas and game shows set the stage for the rise of the explosive daytime format of the '90s: the talk show.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20260208040000 +0000" stop="20260208050000 +0000"><title>Dirty Talk: When Daytime Talk Shows Ruled TV</title><desc>By the mid-'90s, daytime talk shows had earned the name "Trash TV," with many guests willing to air their dirty laundry on national TV;

Justin Leake and his cousin encounter when December turns unseasonably warm. It’s a grey morning with thick fog so Justin and Capt. Brent Berry won’t be heading offshore right away as planned. Instead, Justin turns to his Humminbird CoastMaster charts to pinpoint a near shore artificial reef just five minutes from the St. Andrews Pass, where the anglers will do a little fishing until the fog burns off. Capt. Leake opts to send a jig to the bottom and he’s not very picky about the one that gets tied on. “When fishing reefs, the specific jig doesn’t matter because it’s all about the presentation,” he says. “When you’re sitting on top of a wreck, break out the ‘junk jigs’ – they get bit just fine.” And that proves to be the case as Justin and Brent enjoy non-stop battles against amberjack, red snapper and bonita. And with a bite this good, there’s no reason to go anywhere else!

Justin Leake and his cousin encounter when December turns unseasonably warm. It’s a grey morning with thick fog so Justin and Capt. Brent Berry won’t be heading offshore right away as planned. Instead, Justin turns to his Humminbird CoastMaster charts to pinpoint a near shore artificial reef just five minutes from the St. Andrews Pass, where the anglers will do a little fishing until the fog burns off. Capt. Leake opts to send a jig to the bottom and he’s not very picky about the one that gets tied on. “When fishing reefs, the specific jig doesn’t matter because it’s all about the presentation,” he says. “When you’re sitting on top of a wreck, break out the ‘junk jigs’ – they get bit just fine.” And that proves to be the case as Justin and Brent enjoy non-stop battles against amberjack, red snapper and bonita. And with a bite this good, there’s no reason to go anywhere else!
