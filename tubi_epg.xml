In this episode of Flavor on the Fly, Ranga digs deep into his Sri Lankan roots to come up with a seafood curry dish like none other. Inspired by time spent with good friends, fly fishing for both smallmouth and striped bass, and harvesting local shellfish, this tour through the Pine Tree State results in a one-of-a-kind dish that gives cooking with local ingredients a whole new meaning. Follow as we crack open the shell of one of the most intricate and diverse fisheries Ranga has ever explored.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20250731160010 +0000" stop="20250731163002 +0000"><title>Browning Films</title><desc>Kyle Barefield and Cole Barthel from All Things Hunting are taking turns filming and hunting Mule Deer in Colorado where they both harvest big mature Colorado bucks with Browning 6.8 Westerns at long range.

Devoid of clams—which naturally filter the water—the lagoon’s water quality rapidly deteriorated as algae blooms went unchecked and sunlight could no longer reach the seagrass that is so vital to the lagoon’s ecosystem. 30 years later, a professor at the University of Florida teams up with a well-known deep sea fishing guide to launch the Indian River Clam Restoration Project. After scouring the lagoon and finding ONLY 39 surviving clams, Dr. Todd Osborne and Captain Blair Wiggins—with the help of local residents and businesses—begin carefully breeding “super clams" to restore the dwindling clam population in the Indian River Lagoon. “The Captain &amp; the Super Clams” is more than a human intervention success story; it’s a beautiful buddy film that shows the power of community, science, and technology coming together to find an innovative solution for bio-diversity protection.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20250801025154 +0000" stop="20250801030000 +0000"><title>Rivers are Life</title><desc>The Rivers are Life team joins the Michigan Department of Natural Resources on the St. Clair River to assist in catching and tagging lake sturgeon as part of an ongoing conservation effort.

The project supports sturgeon population recovery through egg collection, hatchery programs, and community events like Port Huron’s Sturgeon Fest, organized by the Friends of the St. Clair River. Every year since its inception in 2012, Sturgeon Fest has released young sturgeon back into the wild, contributing to the unique species' resurgence in the Great Lakes region. This year, the Rivers are Life team helped tag two juvenile sturgeons, which made their debut in the popular festival's touch tank before release.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20250801030000 +0000" stop="20250801033000 +0000"><title>Modern Hunter</title><desc>Noah Rucks heads to the rolling hills of Kentucky with hopes high and tags in his pocket.

Justin Leake and his cousin encounter when December turns unseasonably warm. It’s a grey morning with thick fog so Justin and Capt. Brent Berry won’t be heading offshore right away as planned. Instead, Justin turns to his Humminbird CoastMaster charts to pinpoint a near shore artificial reef just five minutes from the St. Andrews Pass, where the anglers will do a little fishing until the fog burns off. Capt. Leake opts to send a jig to the bottom and he’s not very picky about the one that gets tied on. “When fishing reefs, the specific jig doesn’t matter because it’s all about the presentation,” he says. “When you’re sitting on top of a wreck, break out the ‘junk jigs’ – they get bit just fine.” And that proves to be the case as Justin and Brent enjoy non-stop battles against amberjack, red snapper and bonita. And with a bite this good, there’s no reason to go anywhere else!

Devoid of clams—which naturally filter the water—the lagoon’s water quality rapidly deteriorated as algae blooms went unchecked and sunlight could no longer reach the seagrass that is so vital to the lagoon’s ecosystem. 30 years later, a professor at the University of Florida teams up with a well-known deep sea fishing guide to launch the Indian River Clam Restoration Project. After scouring the lagoon and finding ONLY 39 surviving clams, Dr. Todd Osborne and Captain Blair Wiggins—with the help of local residents and businesses—begin carefully breeding “super clams" to restore the dwindling clam population in the Indian River Lagoon. “The Captain &amp; the Super Clams” is more than a human intervention success story; it’s a beautiful buddy film that shows the power of community, science, and technology coming together to find an innovative solution for bio-diversity protection.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20250801025154 +0000" stop="20250801030000 +0000"><title>Rivers are Life</title><desc>The Rivers are Life team joins the Michigan Department of Natural Resources on the St. Clair River to assist in catching and tagging lake sturgeon as part of an ongoing conservation effort.

The project supports sturgeon population recovery through egg collection, hatchery programs, and community events like Port Huron’s Sturgeon Fest, organized by the Friends of the St. Clair River. Every year since its inception in 2012, Sturgeon Fest has released young sturgeon back into the wild, contributing to the unique species' resurgence in the Great Lakes region. This year, the Rivers are Life team helped tag two juvenile sturgeons, which made their debut in the popular festival's touch tank before release.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20250801030000 +0000" stop="20250801033000 +0000"><title>Modern Hunter</title><desc>Noah Rucks heads to the rolling hills of Kentucky with hopes high and tags in his pocket.

Justin Leake and his cousin encounter when December turns unseasonably warm. It’s a grey morning with thick fog so Justin and Capt. Brent Berry won’t be heading offshore right away as planned. Instead, Justin turns to his Humminbird CoastMaster charts to pinpoint a near shore artificial reef just five minutes from the St. Andrews Pass, where the anglers will do a little fishing until the fog burns off. Capt. Leake opts to send a jig to the bottom and he’s not very picky about the one that gets tied on. “When fishing reefs, the specific jig doesn’t matter because it’s all about the presentation,” he says. “When you’re sitting on top of a wreck, break out the ‘junk jigs’ – they get bit just fine.” And that proves to be the case as Justin and Brent enjoy non-stop battles against amberjack, red snapper and bonita. And with a bite this good, there’s no reason to go anywhere else! Also, we take a look at the United States Coast Guard Auxiliary’s new paddle craft safety initiative.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20250801060000 +0000" stop="20250801062959 +0000"><title>FinQuest</title><desc>In Episode 3 of FinQuest, Ryan Miller joins Captain Alex from Supremacy Fishing Charters for an offshore adventure targeting big fish off shore.
