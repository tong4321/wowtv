Every summer, the Amateur Trapshooting Association hosts The Grand American in Sparta, Illinois. This year marks the 125th Anniversary for the largest trap shooting competition in the world. We’ll talk with the people who make this tournament run behind the scenes and explore what makes this tournament such a special event. We’ll also look at the rich history of The Grand. On-site we’ll chat with the curator of the Trapshooting Hall of Fame and look at some of the incredible historical pieces on display in the museum. Additionally, we’ll learn about White Flyer and how the clay manufacturer has made important innovations for the shotgun sports.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20251022100000 +0000" stop="20251022103001 +0000"><title>Ship Shape TV</title><desc>During this episode of Ship Shape TV Essentials the SSTV team is at John’s lake house on Tupper Lake, NY.

After an officer was gunned down at point-blank range, the psychotic killer led investigators across the Midwest. No one knew where the gunman would strike next, even as his tally of murders and abductions grew. The FBI and state police raced against time to rescue America's heartland from this deranged gunman, before he killed again.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000091" start="20251022142300 +0000" stop="20251022152100 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>A Labor Day weekend turned into a nightmare of murder as a cross-country crime spree terrorized the nation.  In a small Ohio community, an elderly woman and a teenage boy disappeared within hours of each other.  Police believed the cases were linked, but didn't know how. They contacted the FBI for help.  A trail of stolen vehicles and murder victims across seven states led agents on a hunt for two suspected killers. Their only hope of stopping them was to anticipate the killers' next move.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000091" start="20251022152100 +0000" stop="20251022161900 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>A day that began with a class field trip ended with a parent's worst nightmare.

The FBI soon joined the investigation and family and friends worked with detectives and agents in an urgent search for the missing girl.  Faced with conflicting witness reports and false leads, agents wouldn't stop until they found the girl, and the truth.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000091" start="20251022161900 +0000" stop="20251022172000 +0000"><title>Los archivos del FBI (Doblado)</title><desc>El primero de octubre de 1993, un extraño secuestró a Polly Klaas de doce años durante una piyamada en su casa. El FBI de inmediato entró en el caso. Los agentes reunieron fibras de su habitación y descubrieron, a través del uso de fuentes de luz láser, la huella de una palma en la cama de Polly, previamente invisible al ojo humano. Después de una extensa investigación de dos meses, el FBI arrestó a Richard Allen Davis.

When it became clear they could no longer police themselves, the FBI got involved. Putting their lives on the line, undercover agents devised a way to flush out the violent cops and restore trust in the city's police force.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000091" start="20251022211000 +0000" stop="20251022221000 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>He was a recluse who spread terror through the mail for 18 years.
