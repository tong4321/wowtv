Led by Cory Redwine, Conservation Director of Project SeaSafe, this is the 4th Annual Clean Water Collective and it’s bigger than ever. This time, we’re in Grant, Florida, where 4 million clams are being released into the Indian River Lagoon, paired with the planting of thousands of mangroves, oyster work by CCA and trash clean ups to help restore one of Florida’s most critical ecosystems. But it’s not just about hard work—it’s about connection. With local captains, fishing legends, and the Local Knowledge crew on hand, we hit the water to show why this place is worth fighting for. From clam drops by drone, to in-water mangrove planting, to monster snook catches, this is hands-on conservation at its best. This two-part series kicks off with action, heart, and the kind of hope only a healthy waterway can bring. Don’t miss Part 1—where conservation meets community and everyone gets their hands wet.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20250930190001 +0000" stop="20250930193001 +0000"><title>saltwater experience</title><desc>"Captains Tom Rowland and Rich Tudor patiently pursue big tarpon from the Everglades to the Middle Keys with fly rod in hand."</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20250930193001 +0000" stop="20250930200000 +0000"><title>Saltwater Experience</title><desc>Captains Tom Rowland and Rich Tudor are joined by Florida Keys guide Richard Black for an exciting adventure in Key Largo, catching a wide variety of fish species on the shallow reef.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20250930200000 +0000" stop="20250930203000 +0000"><title>Saltwater Experience</title><desc>Captains Tom Rowland and Rich Tudor are joined by Florida Keys guide Jeff Malone to find a frenzy of exciting Bluefish near Marathon, FL.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20250930203000 +0000" stop="20250930210001 +0000"><title>Saltwater Experience</title><desc>Captains Tom Rowland and Rich Tudor are joined by Florida Keys guide Jeff Malone to find a productive wreck with which they enjoy the exciting variety of fish that wrecks can provide.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20250930210001 +0000" stop="20250930213001 +0000"><title>Saltwater Experience</title><desc>Captains Tom Rowland and Rich Tudor are joined by marine scientist Nick Castillo to search for bonefish in Key Largo for both fun and study.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20250930213001 +0000" stop="20250930220000 +0000"><title>Saltwater Experience</title><desc>Captains Tom Rowland and Rich Tudor take a trip to the Marathon, FL area to challenge some feisty sharks and sneaky snook.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20250930220000 +0000" stop="20250930223001 +0000"><title>Captain's Log</title><desc>Deep in the Everglades, Capt.

Led by Cory Redwine, Conservation Director of Project SeaSafe, this is the 4th Annual Clean Water Collective and it’s bigger than ever. This time, we’re in Grant, Florida, where 4 million clams are being released into the Indian River Lagoon, paired with the planting of thousands of mangroves, oyster work by CCA and trash clean ups to help restore one of Florida’s most critical ecosystems. But it’s not just about hard work—it’s about connection. With local captains, fishing legends, and the Local Knowledge crew on hand, we hit the water to show why this place is worth fighting for. From clam drops by drone, to in-water mangrove planting, to monster snook catches, this is hands-on conservation at its best. This two-part series kicks off with action, heart, and the kind of hope only a healthy waterway can bring. Don’t miss Part 1—where conservation meets community and everyone gets their hands wet.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20250930190001 +0000" stop="20250930193001 +0000"><title>saltwater experience</title><desc>"Captains Tom Rowland and Rich Tudor patiently pursue big tarpon from the Everglades to the Middle Keys with fly rod in hand."</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20250930193001 +0000" stop="20250930200000 +0000"><title>Saltwater Experience</title><desc>Captains Tom Rowland and Rich Tudor are joined by Florida Keys guide Richard Black for an exciting adventure in Key Largo, catching a wide variety of fish species on the shallow reef.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20250930200000 +0000" stop="20250930203000 +0000"><title>Saltwater Experience</title><desc>Captains Tom Rowland and Rich Tudor are joined by Florida Keys guide Jeff Malone to find a frenzy of exciting Bluefish near Marathon, FL.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20250930203000 +0000" stop="20250930210001 +0000"><title>Saltwater Experience</title><desc>Captains Tom Rowland and Rich Tudor are joined by Florida Keys guide Jeff Malone to find a productive wreck with which they enjoy the exciting variety of fish that wrecks can provide.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20250930210001 +0000" stop="20250930213001 +0000"><title>Saltwater Experience</title><desc>Captains Tom Rowland and Rich Tudor are joined by marine scientist Nick Castillo to search for bonefish in Key Largo for both fun and study.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20250930213001 +0000" stop="20250930220000 +0000"><title>Saltwater Experience</title><desc>Captains Tom Rowland and Rich Tudor take a trip to the Marathon, FL area to challenge some feisty sharks and sneaky snook.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20250930220000 +0000" stop="20250930223001 +0000"><title>Captain's Log</title><desc>Deep in the Everglades, Capt.
