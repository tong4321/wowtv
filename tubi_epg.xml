In Desert Ghost, Will Cooper heads west to Marathon, Texas, with longtime friend and mentor Cody Roberts to hunt aoudad in one of the most remote landscapes in the state. Rooted in family legacy, this film explores Cody’s deep ties to the desert, the story behind Desert Ghost Distillery, and the mystique of a western oasis near Big Bend National Park. More than a hunt, Desert Ghost dives into the role of aoudad management and its importance to desert bighorn sheep conservation efforts led by Texas Parks and Wildlife and the Wild Sheep Foundation. Sometimes, to protect what belongs here — you have to chase the ghosts. You really do have to be tough, determined, or one lucky bastard to make it out in West Texas.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20260219010012 +0000" stop="20260219013001 +0000"><title>Black Cloud</title><desc>Dr. Duck and Billy Campbell sit down to discuss the week No. 1 ups and downs, and what they learned during their first run hunting public ducks up north.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20260219013001 +0000" stop="20260219014958 +0000"><title>Realtree Road Trips</title><desc>Dink Watson and Sheldon Lye of New Zealand Hunting Adventures host Tyler Jordan on an unforgettable turkey hunt in New Zealand.

More than a hunt, Desert Ghost dives into the role of aoudad management and its importance to desert bighorn sheep conservation efforts led by Texas Parks and Wildlife and the Wild Sheep Foundation. Sometimes, to protect what belongs here — you have to chase the ghosts.
