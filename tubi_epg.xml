Led by Cory Redwine, Conservation Director of Project SeaSafe, this is the 4th Annual Clean Water Collective and it’s bigger than ever. This time, we’re in Grant, Florida, where 4 million clams are being released into the Indian River Lagoon, paired with the planting of thousands of mangroves, oyster work by CCA and trash clean ups to help restore one of Florida’s most critical ecosystems. But it’s not just about hard work—it’s about connection. With local captains, fishing legends, and the Local Knowledge crew on hand, we hit the water to show why this place is worth fighting for. From clam drops by drone, to in-water mangrove planting, to monster snook catches, this is hands-on conservation at its best. This two-part series kicks off with action, heart, and the kind of hope only a healthy waterway can bring. Don’t miss Part 1—where conservation meets community and everyone gets their hands wet.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20250922020001 +0000" stop="20250922023001 +0000"><title>Sail Kings</title><desc>Featuring Capt.

Led by Cory Redwine, Conservation Director of Project SeaSafe, this is the 4th Annual Clean Water Collective and it’s bigger than ever. This time, we’re in Grant, Florida, where 4 million clams are being released into the Indian River Lagoon, paired with the planting of thousands of mangroves, oyster work by CCA and trash clean ups to help restore one of Florida’s most critical ecosystems. But it’s not just about hard work—it’s about connection. With local captains, fishing legends, and the Local Knowledge crew on hand, we hit the water to show why this place is worth fighting for. From clam drops by drone, to in-water mangrove planting, to monster snook catches, this is hands-on conservation at its best. This two-part series kicks off with action, heart, and the kind of hope only a healthy waterway can bring. Don’t miss Part 1—where conservation meets community and everyone gets their hands wet.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20250922020001 +0000" stop="20250922023001 +0000"><title>Sail Kings</title><desc>Featuring Capt.

mientras cruzaban el condado de Neshoba. Una investigación del FBI a gran escala llevó a la recuperación de los cuerpos de los hombres asesinados y la evidencia física fue recuperada y analizada. Los laboratorios del FBI confirmaron que todas excepto una de las balas usadas para asesinar a los hombres provenían de la misma arma.  El FBI se ganó la confianza de un informante, cuya información condujo a la condena de siete miembros del Ku Klux Klan local.</desc></programme><programme channel="682630" start="20250922020000 +0000" stop="20250922030000 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>In the early 1980's, a pair of serial bank robbers gained a reputation among law enforcement officials as formidable bandits.  Using the same modus operandi, the two men took hostages and emptied bank vaults across the Midwest.  After the criminals escaped from police custody, FBI agents familiar with the bandits believed that they would attempt a grand-scale heist.  By conducting surveillance on known associates of the criminals, authorities tried to anticipate the next target.</desc></programme><programme channel="682630" start="20250922030000 +0000" stop="20250922040000 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>In 1991, the Safe Streets Task Force, a joint FBI / Washington D.C.

Left behind was a mysterious ransom note listing twelve names and no specific instructions.  The note, and a few drops of blood were the only clues to her fate. FBI and local police struggled to find answers in the cryptic message so they could find the kidnapper and retrieve the victim before her time ran out. Solving the crime required the keen insight of a criminal profiler and the perseverance of a family, local authorities, and the FBI.</desc></programme><programme channel="682630" start="20250922050000 +0000" stop="20250922060000 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>In June of 2000, two gunmen rob a Seattle, WA bank, and flee on foot as officers chase them.
