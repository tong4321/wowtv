Yet, within this pursuit lies a distinct niche: trophy hunting via swimbait fishing. Unlike traditional baits, swimbaits stand out in their uniqueness within an angler's arsenal. Ranging from six to twelve-plus inches in length and weighing two to sixteen ounces, these baits require a quiver of specialized equipment and a different mindset. The adage "big bait, big fish" is the guiding principle, firmly centered on catching the biggest bass in the lake, armed with the largest baits from your tackle box.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20260113150000 +0000" stop="20260113153002 +0000"><title>Goin' Coastal</title><desc>Fishing with the Mayor Description: Join the Major of destin as he ventures into the world of coastal fishing, leaving the city behind for a day of fun and unexpected challenges.

But it’s not just about hard work—it’s about connection. With local captains, fishing legends, and the Local Knowledge crew on hand, we hit the water to show why this place is worth fighting for. From clam drops by drone, to in-water mangrove planting, to monster snook catches, this is hands-on conservation at its best. This two-part series kicks off with action, heart, and the kind of hope only a healthy waterway can bring.

Yet, within this pursuit lies a distinct niche: trophy hunting via swimbait fishing. Unlike traditional baits, swimbaits stand out in their uniqueness within an angler's arsenal. Ranging from six to twelve-plus inches in length and weighing two to sixteen ounces, these baits require a quiver of specialized equipment and a different mindset. The adage "big bait, big fish" is the guiding principle, firmly centered on catching the biggest bass in the lake, armed with the largest baits from your tackle box.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20260113150000 +0000" stop="20260113153002 +0000"><title>Goin' Coastal</title><desc>Fishing with the Mayor Description: Join the Major of destin as he ventures into the world of coastal fishing, leaving the city behind for a day of fun and unexpected challenges.
