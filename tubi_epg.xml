But on this episode of DIRT, we’re digging into the unexpected side of the state (UFO rumors and all). Whether surfing infinite river waves, cultivating perfect carrot seeds, or fly fishing in downtown Denver’s shadow—geeky passions run high. Follow along as we gather ingredients for a farm to table final feast equal parts foraged, free-range, and free-thinking.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20251219154705 +0000" stop="20251219163149 +0000"><title>Dirt</title><desc>Huckberry's flagship adventure series is back in Japan and the DIRT crew is hungry as ever for adventure. This time, they’re diving into the Kansai region—where millennia-old traditions flow from the shore of Lake Biwa to surf breaks on the coast. Chef Coleman Griffin gives them a taste of the deep cultural immersion that inspires his culinary practice, from chef knives descended from samurai swords to fermented carp that went on to spawn sushi. And turns out, the perfect meal does exist, and the crew knew it as soon as they had a bite of their final omakase.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20251219163149 +0000" stop="20251219170017 +0000"><title>Dirt</title><desc>In Episode 2: New Orleans, Josh links up with Mason Hereford (owner of award-winning sandwich shop Turkey and the Wolf) and then hits the road for some epic hog hunting, swamp fishing, crawfish and oyster harvesting, and exploring Louisiana’s only water buffalo dairy farm.

Because of a combination of threats, from pollution to climate change, the densely populated area’s fish populations are dwindling – but locals are educating themselves on ways to make change. In this beautifully photographed award-winning film, we get a rare glimpse into life on the lake while learning how a dedicated conservation group is combatting plastic pollution.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20251219234848 +0000" stop="20251220000020 +0000"><title>Rivers are Life</title><desc>Nathalie Lasselin is a diver, filmmaker and activist who has explored everything from the Arctic to underwater caves in China; yet this River Hero finds herself pulled back to the waters of her home, Montreal, to help clean up the St. Lawrence River.
