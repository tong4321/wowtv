The lucky 12 that move through, battle it out with a giant toothbrush Sweeper. ‘Nat with the Tats’ and Renee ‘Lets get physical’ move through to the Dreadmill, flying the banner for the ladies. Look out for Scotty Six Toes at the Big Balls and get the ear plugs ready as you meet Herr Chris.

Barnaby and Jones are soon on the case, trying to establish who would have wanted the elderly man dead.
