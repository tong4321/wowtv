Led by Cory Redwine, Conservation Director of Project SeaSafe, this is the 4th Annual Clean Water Collective and it’s bigger than ever. This time, we’re in Grant, Florida, where 4 million clams are being released into the Indian River Lagoon, paired with the planting of thousands of mangroves, oyster work by CCA and trash clean ups to help restore one of Florida’s most critical ecosystems. But it’s not just about hard work—it’s about connection. With local captains, fishing legends, and the Local Knowledge crew on hand, we hit the water to show why this place is worth fighting for. From clam drops by drone, to in-water mangrove planting, to monster snook catches, this is hands-on conservation at its best. This two-part series kicks off with action, heart, and the kind of hope only a healthy waterway can bring. Don’t miss Part 1—where conservation meets community and everyone gets their hands wet.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20260107000001 +0000" stop="20260107003002 +0000"><title>Fly Shop Tour</title><desc>This episode we make our way through Florida, where we stop in Key West, Marathon, Bonita Springs, and Sanibel Island.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20260107003002 +0000" stop="20260107010001 +0000"><title>Destination Dive</title><desc>In this episode, we will highlight what’s being done in the Florida Keys to protect and save the reefs.

Back in his old stomping grounds, Josh first meets up with the award-winning chef and Mumbai native, Chintan Pandya, currently blowing up the New York food scene with his unapologetic and authentic Indian cuisine (pro tip: try the goat brains). Next, Josh travels through the boroughs, heads upstate, and along the coast to source local ingredients—from sake brewers and pig farmers to catching fresh lobster just 100 miles from Wall Street. As always the adventure will end with a feast, right back in Chintan’s kitchen.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20260107070001 +0000" stop="20260107073001 +0000"><title>Realtree Roadtrips</title><desc>Riley Green, Greg Camp, and Ben McDonald cap off an incredible 2024 hunting season with 2 epic hunts down in Louisiana.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20260107073001 +0000" stop="20260107080001 +0000"><title>Realtree Roadtrips</title><desc>Tyler Jordan is hunting a true giant at one of his favorite places to hunt in the Southeast.

This time, we’re in Grant, Florida, where 4 million clams are being released into the Indian River Lagoon, paired with the planting of thousands of mangroves, oyster work by CCA and trash clean ups to help restore one of Florida’s most critical ecosystems. But it’s not just about hard work—it’s about connection. With local captains, fishing legends, and the Local Knowledge crew on hand, we hit the water to show why this place is worth fighting for. From clam drops by drone, to in-water mangrove planting, to monster snook catches, this is hands-on conservation at its best. This two-part series kicks off with action, heart, and the kind of hope only a healthy waterway can bring.
