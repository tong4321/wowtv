After careful planning and waiting for the right wind, I finally set out on September 11. With my crossbow in hand, I waited anxiously in the stand, my heart racing as the shadows lengthened.

Having hunted Kentucky for over a decade and established my own properties—Bootleggers Ridge and Stonewall Plantation—I was eager for the chance at such a remarkable deer. Despite having drawn a coveted caribou tag through Worldwide Trophy Adventures’ TAGS Program, the allure of FREAK SHOW was too strong to resist. After careful planning and waiting for the right wind, I finally set out on September 11. With my crossbow in hand, I waited anxiously in the stand, my heart racing as the shadows lengthened. Just when I thought the evening might end without a sighting, a movement caught my eye, sending my pulse soaring. With caution, FREAK SHOW appeared.</desc></programme><channel id="400000065"><display-name>Top Gear</display-name><icon src="https://canvas-lb.tubitv.com/opts/g_SN11NtWr_adw==/45d06aa3-8a80-4864-a7b0-25a606d26be3/CHgQeDoFMS4xLjhAAQ==" /></channel><programme channel="400000065" start="20251003082009 +0000" stop="20251003092816 +0000"><title>Top Gear UK</title><desc>The lads somehow find themselves entered in a terrifying French ice race.

At the lavish reception at Bledlow Hall that follows, however, tragedy strikes - maid of honour Marina Fellowes is found murdered in one of the rooms by some of the guests. With their honeymoon cancelled, the Fitzroys must contend with a police presence in their home, as Barnaby and Jones try to learn more about the family history. It soon becomes clear there are secrets, deception, and an illegtimate son involved in the mystery, which is further complicated when the estate manager is killed by an arrow.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20251004083600 +0000" stop="20251004102500 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>It's a good day for the Hicks family, as the name of Tommy Hicks - who was executed during World War I for "cowardice and desertion" - is added to the list on Midsomer Parva's war memorial. Tommy's son Lionel and grandson Dave, mayor of Causton and whom Barnaby does not like (owing to dodgy building work by the mayor's company), are thrilled, but the snooty Hammonds are decidedly less pleased. Henry, the patriarch of the Hammond family, is particularly riled by his insalubrious neighbours, and has nurtured a long-running feud with the Hickses. But the evening after a battle re-enactment in the village, Henry is murdered - and Barnaby must delve into the history of the two families to find the killer, discovering a web of fraud, lies, and hidden truths.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20251004102500 +0000" stop="20251004121600 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>Barnaby and Jones are in Dunstan to investigate the deaths of a reclusive couple. As they try to establish whether Ron and Libby Wilson were murdered or died of natural causes, their attention is drawn to a dispute raging between a local builder and road protesters nearby. When another death occurs, the detectives learn that there are plenty of dark secrets and fierce hostilities in this apparently idyllic village. Will Jack Purdy's quick temper lead to violence? How far would the protesters go to prevent the bypass being built? And do current events somehow relate to the death of Michael Wilson many years earlier?</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20251004121600 +0000" stop="20251004140600 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>When the body of Londoner Charlie Finleyson is discovered in woodland near Midsomer Sonning, Barnaby and Jones find themselves investigating employees at local Midsomer Life magazine.

As the detectives become aware of a feud between Guy and the proprietor of the Morecroft Hotel, tensions are also heating up between the locals and visiting Londoners.
