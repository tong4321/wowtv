and his girlfriend Laura Sharp - absolutely nothing could ruin their date. The next morning, when Frances Kirby is out for her morning jog, she notices the vintage car they were in up at the airfield, containing Simon Bright's dead body, with Laura nowhere to be seen. Confused, Detective Chief Inspector Barnaby and D.S. Jones can't work out whether it was a suicide pact or murder. Furthermore, they've got to find Miss Sharp and their investigation leads them to linking Simon and Laura with the villagers of Morton Fendle, who met at Elaine Trim's dancing classes. Eventually, the Barnaby family plus Jones make it to a 40s style dance night at the village hall before more villagers start turning up dead.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20260214175800 +0000" stop="20260214194900 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>Barnaby is in Midsomer Holm, bidding farewell to reformed criminal Ronnie Tyler, who has taken part in a rehabilitation scheme in the village.

Murders</title><desc>Barnaby is in Midsomer Holm, bidding farewell to reformed criminal Ronnie Tyler, who has taken part in a rehabilitation scheme in the village. Also present is disgraced ex-policeman Jack Colby, a former colleague of Barnaby's – but Jack refuses to talk to his old friend. When Jack is murdered, the detective must delve into the dark secrets in the victim's past. There are certainly dark secrets to uncover, and Barnaby has to determine whether the victim's part in a scandal years earlier at Causton police station, is key to the mystery behind his death. It isn't long before he finds that Eddie Marston is attempting blackmail, and soon murdered as a result, and that Lord Holm is in love with Jack's wife, psychotherapist Gina.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20260215090000 +0000" stop="20260215110000 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>It's a good day for the Hicks family, as the name of Tommy Hicks - who was executed during World War I for "cowardice and desertion" - is added to the list on Midsomer Parva's war memorial. Tommy's son Lionel and grandson Dave, mayor of Causton and whom Barnaby does not like (owing to dodgy building work by the mayor's company), are thrilled, but the snooty Hammonds are decidedly less pleased. Henry, the patriarch of the Hammond family, is particularly riled by his insalubrious neighbours, and has nurtured a long-running feud with the Hickses. But the evening after a battle re-enactment in the village, Henry is murdered - and Barnaby must delve into the history of the two families to find the killer, discovering a web of fraud, lies, and hidden truths.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20260215110000 +0000" stop="20260215120000 +0000"><title>Murdoch Mysteries</title><desc>Murdoch investigates the murder of a young opera singer.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20260215120000 +0000" stop="20260215130000 +0000"><title>Murdoch Mysteries</title><desc>The ambitious inventor of an electric vehicle.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20260215130000 +0000" stop="20260215140000 +0000"><title>Murdoch Mysteries</title><desc>Murdoch meets former lover Anna.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20260215140000 +0000" stop="20260215150000 +0000"><title>Murdoch Mysteries</title><desc>Murdoch investigates the murder of a shy librarian.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20260215150000 +0000" stop="20260215160000 +0000"><title>Murdoch Mysteries</title><desc>Murdoch teams up with Alexander Graham Bell when a ruthless inventor is killed by a rival.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20260215160000 +0000" stop="20260215170000 +0000"><title>Murdoch Mysteries</title><desc>A high stakes card game involving Dr. Grace ends in death.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20260215170000 +0000" stop="20260215180000 +0000"><title>Murdoch Mysteries</title><desc>Murdoch is taunted by a murderer who leaves dolls with personal messages at crime scenes.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20260215180000 +0000" stop="20260215190000 +0000"><title>Murdoch Mysteries</title><desc>The death of a Toronto hockey team captain.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20260215190000 +0000" stop="20260215200000 +0000"><title>Murdoch Mysteries</title><desc>Murdoch meets a man who says he can travel in time to prevent crimes.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20260215200000 +0000" stop="20260215210000 +0000"><title>Murdoch Mysteries</title><desc>Murdoch investigates the crash of a flying machine that killed a man, uncovering conspiracy and sabotage.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20260215210000 +0000" stop="20260215220000 +0000"><title>Magnum</title><desc>Magnum and Higgins must find Kumu when she's kidnapped by an injured man accused of killing his wife.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20260215220000 +0000" stop="20260215230000 +0000"><title>Magnum P.I.</title><desc>Magnum and Higgins go under cover as a couple on a romantic bus tour; a love bird on the trip is murdered and evidence is quickly deteriorating in the Hawaiian heat; TC is shaken when he runs into his ex-girlfriend.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20260215230000 +0000" stop="20260216000000 +0000"><title>Magnum</title><desc>Magnum and Higgins take the case of recovering the stolen urn of a woman's deceased husband, but they soon find that others believe the urn is worth killing for; Rick and TC confront a man who's been impersonating football legend Andre Reed.</desc></programme><channel id="400000071"><display-name>Nikita</display-name><icon src="https://canvas-lb.tubitv.com/opts/XgAOBC0Zv6egUA==/bf6f69f6-4495-4bc2-94f9-fd91877e36f0/CHgQeDoFMS4xLjhAAQ==" /></channel><programme channel="400000071" start="20260214161602 +0000" stop="20260214170512 +0000"><title>La Femme Nikita</title><desc>When a mission goes horribly wrong, Nikita tracks a traitor.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000071" start="20260214170512 +0000" stop="20260214175755 +0000"><title>La Femme Nikita</title><desc>Nikita has a chance to escape from Section One.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000071" start="20260214175755 +0000" stop="20260214185205 +0000"><title>La Femme Nikita</title><desc>Section One must recover a stolen computer file.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000071" start="20260214185205 +0000" stop="20260214194118 +0000"><title>La Femme Nikita</title><desc>Section One tracks down a rogue spy.
